## Motivation

SimpleConv is the CNN used to predict per-rotor RPS (rotations per second) trajectories from drone audio, feeding downstream RPS-conditioned speech enhancement. The original architecture (conv encoder + global-avg-pool head) was never systematically compared against alternatives. Two sequential sweeps asked: (1) which encoder/temporal-head combination minimizes validation and real-recording error, and (2) once a stronger dataset (DREGON-LM-V4-michaels) and online-mixed training are available, does that ranking hold, and can hypothesis-driven variants (attention, causal/streaming heads, frequency-dilated bodies) beat it further.

## Results

**Sweep 1** (10 variants, DREGON-LM, offline fixed 6000/600 train/valid split, hand-run): adding a BiGRU temporal head gave the largest single gain (R² 0.837 → 0.945 over the plain baseline). The best validation model was `v2` (SE + frequency-attention pooling + BiGRU, R²=0.951), but on a real 47s free-flight recording `bigru_v2` (6-block SE encoder + BiGRU, no attention pool) generalized best: in-flight MSE 9.90 vs. baseline's 24.45 (halving the ~19.9 MSE reported for SimpleConv in the original paper). Width scaling (`Wide`, 3.94M params) barely beat baseline; `SE-Next` (SE, no temporal head) was worse than baseline (R²=0.688); multi-scale FPN fusion was unstable and broke on full-sequence inference. All variants failed catastrophically on clean single-rotor recordings (out-of-distribution structural prior).

**Sweep 2** (26 hypothesis-driven variants around `simple_conv_v2`, DREGON-LM-V4-michaels, autonomous research harness, hypotheses H0–H29 in `ideas.md`): each variant was trained twice — offline fixed-train (50 epochs) and online-mixed (200 epochs, augmentation after 50k samples) — on the same fixed validation set. Offline, `simple_conv_v2_smol_causal_tcn` (v2 encoder + SMoLnet-style frequency-dilated refinement + causal TCN head) won on both PIT MSE (8.38) and R² (0.833), narrowly beating the `simple_conv_v2` baseline (7.89 MSE, 0.818 R²). Transformer and local-attention temporal heads underperformed badly offline (R² −0.66 and 0.52). Unidirectional/causal GRU heads were the most volatile: several diverged to NaN offline and scored MSE in the hundreds.

Online-mixed retraining reshuffled the ranking rather than uniformly improving it: 21/26 variants improved, but the offline winner (`smol_causal_tcn`) slipped (8.38→8.99) and the online winner became `simple_conv_v2_uni_gru128` (MSE 7.33, R²=0.822) — a unidirectional GRU that had scored MSE 39.8 (unstable, NaN row) offline. The plain baseline itself drifted slightly worse online (7.89→8.54, though R² rose to 0.833). A follow-up with `--grad_clip 0.5` on the unidirectional-GRU family showed gradient clipping only partially explains the swing: it rescues one offline configuration (`uni_gru128`: 39.8→10.4) but doesn't reach offline-baseline or online-winner quality, and it hurt the online winner (7.33→9.13). Online data diversity removing training instability and autoregressive memorization of a small, fixed trajectory set is the stronger explanation.

## Conclusion

A BiGRU (or GRU-family) temporal head over a conv/SE encoder is the consistent architectural winner across both sweeps and both training regimes; pure width scaling, SE-only (no temporal head), transformer, and unstructured multi-scale fusion all underperform it. Sweep 1 settled `bigru_v2`/`v2` as the practical choice for DREGON-LM-scale training. Sweep 2 shows this generalizes to `simple_conv_v2` as a strong baseline on the richer V4-michaels data, with `smol_causal_tcn` (offline) or wide unidirectional-GRU (online-mixed) as marginal improvements depending on regime — but model selection must be done under the training regime actually used in production (online-mixed), since offline rankings do not transfer. Online mixing is the current default training regime as a result. Open follow-up: the residual temporal-overfitting effect (models still overfitting the small underlying set of RPS trajectories even under acoustic online-mixing) is unaddressed — the proposed fix is augmenting/synthesizing RPS trajectories themselves rather than just their acoustic dressing (see `data_processing/rps_synthesis.py`, OU-mode synthetic RPS generation, as a candidate direction).

## Causal-head follow-up (autoresearch session `20260617-012233`)

Moved here from `src/models/AGENTS.md` (2026-09-07); the code-level summary is
one Gotchas line there.

Simply swapping `BiGRUHead` for a unidirectional GRU was unstable/poor. The
best causal-head variant in that sweep was `simple_conv_v2_uni_gru96_norm_do03`
(GroupNorm + dropout 0.3), still worse than `simple_conv_v2`. Fully
time-causal STFT + left-padded temporal conv variants
(`simple_conv_v2_causal_gru{,96}`) underfit badly, likely due to
alignment/latency and loss of future context; treat them as a separate
front-end/alignment problem, not just a head replacement.

The external SMoLnet reference (`../drone-audition/drone_audition/models/smolnet.py`)
is frequency-dilated in its early `(kernel, 1)` Conv2d layers and uses
symmetric time padding in late square layers, so it is not strictly causal as
written. When adapting a new backbone such as SMoLnet to RPS prediction, run
the cleanest body-only ablation first (body + SimpleConv-style mean-pool
Conv1d head, `smolnet_rps_simple_head`) before adding stronger TCN/GRU/attention
heads; otherwise body and head effects are confounded.
