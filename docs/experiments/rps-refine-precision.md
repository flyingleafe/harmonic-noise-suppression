# RPS refinement precision campaign

**Goal (user, 2026-07-30):** make the iterative RPS refinement chain actually
precise — near-perfect on synthetic free-flight (phases locked, exact GT),
much better on Michael's (FLY124). The slider-demo observations that started
it, each confirmed quantitatively on the three 16 s trace windows
(scratchpad `explainer-traces/trace_*.json`, pipeline = fullrange-v2 blind
arm → pi_kalman):

## Diagnosis (2026-07-30)

Per-stage PIT-MAE and per-round trajectory movement (`|Δ|` mean rev/s per
rotor per round):

| window | after ladder | capture (4 rds) | refine (5 rds) | pi_kalman | final MAE |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| dregon_ramp | 3.230 | Δ≈0.01–0.05/rd | **Δ≈0.002/rd** | Δ≈0.1 | 3.214 |
| fly124_cruise | 1.195 | Δ≈0.02–0.06/rd | **Δ≈0.003/rd** | Δ≈0.1–0.9 | 1.140 |
| synthetic | 1.266 | Δ≈0.03–0.05/rd | **Δ≈0.004/rd** | Δ≈0.2–0.5 | 0.996 |

1. **Coarse coupling.** The coarse Viterbi solves ONE common trajectory
   c(t); all four tracks are c(t)+offset (identical per-rotor |Δ| at the
   viterbi/gates rows). The ladder splits pair means only, never shapes. On
   dregon_ramp the damage is visible as pred-std ≈ 26 for ALL rotors while
   gt-std is 27/23.5/27/23 — the shallower pair carries ~3.6 MAE it cannot
   shed. Shape-corr is 0.975+ (the common shape is right); the per-rotor
   *deviation* from it is unrepresented.
2. **VK refine is dead.** 5 rounds × ~0.003 rev/s = no-op (fly124 even
   degrades 1.170→1.171). Suspects inside `vk_tracking._freq_update`:
   update_gate=30 periodogram gate, Wiener shrink snr/(1+snr), the
   pentadiagonal smoothing solve, or simply that phase slopes are already
   ~0 at its narrow final bands. To be instrumented.
3. **pi_kalman under-used.** It is the only late stage that moves (one call,
   n_iter=3) and gives the largest late improvements (synthetic
   1.198→0.996). Its capture radius is `band_hz/k` (6 Hz half-band → ±0.75
   rev/s at k=8), so post-ladder per-rotor errors of 1–4 rev/s leave most
   harmonics out-of-band — the likely reason it can't fully individuate
   shapes either. But it re-demodulates per outer iteration, so a
   wide→narrow band schedule + more iterations should progressively
   capture.

Final per-rotor decomposition (PIT-aligned): fly124 biases +0.66/+0.89/+0.84/−0.17
with pred-std ~0.7–1.3 vs gt-std 1.4–2.1 (under-tracking + bias); synthetic
biases ~0 but shape-corr only 0.42–0.80 — wiggle amplitude right, placement
wrong (capture/lag, not smoothing excess).

## WP1 verdicts (2026-07-30, instrumented runs; scratchpad `refine-diagnosis/report.md`)

**A — VK refine is dead because its phase slopes are already ≈0; nothing
downstream eats them.** Across 3 windows × 5 rounds × 4 rotors: the no-comb
gate never fired, max_step never clipped, shrink is a mild ×~2, the
smoothing solve attenuates only ×1.2–1.6. The raw Fisher-fused slope RMS is
0.003–0.008 rev/s against true errors of 0.55–1.5 rev/s — the 100–400×
shortfall exists *before* smoothing. Cause: at final bw 1.5 Hz, **0 of 25
harmonics** have |k·err| in-band anywhere (capture at k=6 needs
|err|<0.125 rev/s), while 61–93% sit inside the ±45 Hz demod brickwall —
which is what the gate tests. Refine has converged in its own narrow-band
terms; the residual is invisible to it. → The stage is dead weight at
current bands; drop or re-band it.

**B — pi_kalman's budget = capture × twin-gating interlock; lag refuted.**
corr(|err|, |dGT/dt|) ≈ 0 (over-smoothing is NOT the problem). The
interlock: post-ladder error is per-rotor *differential*; the low harmonics
(k≤4) whose band admits 0.5–1.5 rev/s errors (63–98% frames in-band) are
exactly where twin combs collide → discarded by the twin gate (fly124 tight
pair loses k=1–3 entirely; dregon twin-gated 80–84%, 2 of 4 rotors skipped
outright in iter 1); high k is resolvable but out-of-band (in-band frac
~0.2–0.3 at k=20–40). Errors are tail-dominated: worst decile of frames
carries 33–60% of total |err|; no-evidence frames carry 1.5–5× the error.
In evidence-covered frames MAE stops improving after iter 1 — and on fly124
evidence frames are *no better* (surviving collided low-k increments
endorse the biased track — the S4 sideband/twin-mixture mechanism).
→ Levers: wide→narrow band_hz schedule with re-demodulating iterations,
`pair_mode="joint"` so low-k differential evidence stops being discarded,
more outer iterations; NOT more smoothing or more of band-6 iterations.

## WP2 probe (2026-07-30, `refine-diagnosis/pk_probe.py` from post-ladder ckpts)

pi_kalman variants from the saved post-ladder state (pooled PIT-MAE):

| window | entry | n3 b6 (cur) | wide_joint n6 | wide_gate n6 | joint n3 | n8 sp4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| synthetic | 1.228 | 1.040 | **0.900** | 0.900 | 1.040 | 0.900 |
| fly124_cruise | 1.176 | 1.147 | **1.024** | 1.075 | 1.085 | 1.088 |
| dregon_ramp | 3.272 | 3.265 | 3.292 | 3.293 | 3.265 | 3.287 |

(wide = band_hz (12,9,6,4,2.5,2.5), k_caps (4,6,8,12,20,40), off_comb 16.)
Verdict: schedule helps ~14%, joint helps on fly124's tight pair, but
**kwargs alone plateau far above target**. Synthetic's rotors are
independent OU trajectories — the ladder's common-shape+offsets hypothesis
cannot represent them, and the residual per-rotor deviation is exactly the
error pi_kalman's collided low-k band cannot see. Decoupling is the
critical path for all three windows.

**WP3 design (two mechanisms, different scales):**
1. *Residual corridor Viterbi* (coarse decoupling, ~0.5 rev/s): coordinate
   descent — per-rotor DP in a ±6–8 rev/s corridor around the current
   track, scoring rotor r's comb on the whitened spec with the other
   rotors' current teeth masked; 2–3 sweeps. Repulsion by masking, not
   rigidity.
2. *Residual-audio pi_kalman* (fine decoupling): per rotor, subtract the
   siblings' VK reconstruction (`vk_envelopes`+`vk_reconstruct` on tracks
   ≠ r) from the audio, run pi_kalman on the residual for rotor r —
   removes the twin-collision interlock entirely, unlocking low-k
   evidence at wide bands.

## WP3 probe (2026-07-30, `refine-diagnosis/decouple_probe.py`)

M1 = residual corridor Viterbi (per-rotor offset DP ±8, 0.25 steps, sibling
teeth masked, surface-quality gate); M2 = residual-audio pi_kalman (sibling
VK reconstruction subtracted). Pooled PIT-MAE:

| chain | synthetic | fly124_cruise | dregon_ramp |
|---|---|---|---|
| entry (post-ladder) | 1.228 | 1.176 | 3.272 |
| WP2 plateau | 0.900 | 1.024 | 3.265 |
| A: M1×3 | 0.835 | 1.130 | no-op (all gated) |
| B: M1→wide_joint pk | 0.772 | 1.065 | 3.292 |
| C: M2 full4 ×2 | 0.772 | **1.027** | recon diverges |
| D: M1→M2 | **0.709** | swaps identities | ≡ C |

- **Synthetic: plateau broken by decoupling** (0.900→0.709, entry −42%),
  both mechanisms contribute. Remaining error = capture-tail frames +
  corridor quantization (0.25 rev/s, 7.8 Hz bins) + M2 sweep-2
  oscillation.
- **fly124: one rotor is comb-invisible** in the coarse whitened spec
  (masked surface quality 0.099 vs 0.28–0.34 siblings) — ungated its DP
  runs away onto a sibling comb; and the tight pair latches onto the
  imperfectly-subtracted twin without the geometric gate. Sibling recon
  quality healthy otherwise (resid/orig 0.54–0.91).
- **dregon_ramp: structurally blocked at this layer** — per-rotor surfaces
  uniformly weak (ramp smear), and sibling VK reconstruction diverges
  (resid/orig 2.6–78; tight twins 0.5/0.8 rev/s split + ~4 rev/s track
  errors → the documented cancelling mode). The ramp needs the upstream
  shape fixed (chirp-matched per-rotor scoring is the future lever:
  during the ramp the local slope is KNOWN from c'(t), so per-rotor teeth
  can be scored by matched summation along the chirp direction).

**Round-2 plan (goal priorities: synthetic → fly124; dregon deferred):**
(a) port M1/M2 into `scripts/rps_refine_lab.py` as chain stages;
(b) alternating M1/M2 rounds with per-round corridor shrink (±4→±2, step
0.1, interpolated sub-bin scoring) + a final narrow-band gate-mode
pi_kalman polish (band (2.5,2,1.5), k→40), convergence-stopped;
(c) fly124: residual re-seed of the comb-invisible rotor — subtract the 3
well-tracked rotors' reconstruction, wide comb re-scan of the residual at
8192-FFT for the weak rotor's true base, then corridor-track it; per-mic
surface selection as fallback.

## WP4 — the synthetic error budget, measured (2026-07-30)

Round-2's `alt_loop` reproduced the WP3 probe at round 1 (0.711) but **degraded
in rounds 2-4** (0.717 → 0.754). Chasing that produced a full accounting of
what actually limits precision. Probes: `refine-diagnosis/{floor,floor2,
iterate,denoise,snr,err_spectrum,ess,alias_check,bandlimited_synth,
converge_clean,sibsub_clean}_probe.py`.

**1. The estimator's floor is 0.05, not 0.4.** Holding an exact-GT init costs
only 0.055 rev/s. Constant offsets up to ±1 rev/s are removed to ~0.1; ±2 is
outside capture. So precision is not intrinsically limited.

**2. Iteration is HARMFUL, not helpful.** Every schedule peaks after ONE
application and then degrades monotonically (0.167 → 0.268 over 5 repeats):
each pass injects ~0.05 rev/s of fresh estimation noise that accumulates
additively in the track. *This is why alt_loop's rounds 2-4 lost ground.*
Design rule: one M1 sweep set + ONE M2 pass, no convergence loop, no extra
polish (the polish pass also only adds noise).

**3. The residual is SNR-independent → not measurement noise.** From a
shape-deficient init: 0 dB 0.413, 10 dB 0.334, 20 dB 0.337, 40 dB 0.336. At
essentially noiseless data the estimator still lands 0.3 from truth.

**4. It is a BANDWIDTH limit + a benchmark artifact.** Error power per band
(40 dB): below 0.5 Hz the estimator recovers 99.9% of GT's power (err/GT power
ratio 0.001-0.006), 2-4 Hz ~0.2, above 8 Hz ~1.0 (nothing recovered). GT holds
70.7% of its power below 0.5 Hz but the residual is 47% in 8-16 Hz — the
frame-grid Nyquist edge. Two causes, neither the estimator's fault: the
`rps_synthesis` OU drive is white to the 250 Hz generation rate (a real rotor's
inertia cannot follow that), and GT is point-sampled onto the 31.25 Hz frame
grid with `np.interp` (no anti-alias), folding it all back in. `ess` was
exonerated (forcing ess=1.0 changes nothing).
*Reality check (`shaft_bw.py`): DREGON's 1 kHz `motors_measured` has only 82%
of AC power below 5 Hz vs the synthetic's 97% — real shafts are, if anything,
rougher, so the synthetic is a fair benchmark; it is the SAMPLING that is
wrong, not the roughness.*

**5. With a physical shaft band-limit the numbers move** (lowpass the OU
trajectory before synthesizing audio AND defining GT): fc=None 0.354 → fc=12
0.277 → fc=8 0.221 → fc=5 0.186 (all 40 dB, one pass).

**6. What remains at high SNR is INTER-ROTOR INTERFERENCE.** On clean
band-limited data an *oracle* M2 (siblings reconstructed from GT) reaches
**0.081** vs plain 0.193 and blind M2-solo 0.157. At 0 dB the oracle (0.201)
equals blind M2-solo (0.203) — additive noise then dominates and no sibling
scheme can do better.

### The floor, stated honestly

| condition | achievable |
|---|---|
| exact init, hold | 0.055 |
| fc=5 Hz, 40 dB, oracle sibling removal | 0.081 |
| fc=5 Hz, 40 dB, blind M2-solo | 0.157 |
| fc=5 Hz, **0 dB** (battery setting), oracle == blind | ~0.20 |
| unphysical OU + point-sampled GT, 0 dB | ~0.35 |

So "<0.1 on synthetic" is **not attainable at 0 dB comb-vs-noise SNR** — the
oracle proves the evidence does not support it. It IS attainable at high SNR
with sibling removal. The honest target for the 0 dB battery is ~0.2-0.3,
against which the current pipeline (0.71 trace window, 2.90 battery) has
**3-10x of real headroom**. Any claim of "near-perfect" must state the SNR and
the GT sampling convention.

### Consequent design (supersedes the Round-2 alt_loop)

`refine_v2`: ladder(capture) → M1 corridor sweeps (per-rotor decoupling,
±8@0.25 then ±4@0.1) → **single** M2-solo pass (sibling-subtracted
pi_kalman, PK_WIDE) → stop. No loop, no polish. Report against both the
point-sampled GT (protocol convention) and a band-limited GT (physical
convention), and always alongside the oracle floor for that window.

## WP5 — does dropping VK refine cost amplitude matching? No. (2026-07-30)

`VKResult` carries two independent products: `r_refined` (the trajectory,
updated by the refine rounds) and `envelopes` (the complex per-(rotor,
harmonic) amplitudes from `vk_envelopes`, a **readout** of *(audio,
trajectory, cfg)*). The refine loop only touches the first. Measured with
`refine-diagnosis/amp_check{,2}.py` — VK reconstruction residual ratio
‖x−x̂‖/‖x‖ under RECON_CFG (k 1..30), lower = the harmonic model explains
more:

| window | entry | after VK refine | after pi_kalman | with GT traj |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| synth_trace (0 dB; perfect-comb removal = 0.7071) | 0.7066 | 0.7068 | **0.6845** | 0.6606 |
| fly124_cruise | 0.5774 | 0.5774 | **0.5300** | 0.5498 |
| dregon_ramp (REFINE_CFG) | 1.8191 | 1.8138 | **0.9898** | — |

- VK refine changes the amplitude model by ~0 (fly124: identical to four
  decimals) — a third independent confirmation that the stage is inert.
- A pi_kalman trajectory **improves** the amplitude model on every window,
  because envelopes are a readout: better trajectory → better envelopes. On
  dregon_ramp the VK reconstruction was *diverging* (ratio 1.82 > 1: it added
  energy rather than explaining it — the WP3 cancelling mode) and a better
  trajectory fixes it outright.
- So the refine rounds can be dropped with no amplitude cost; VK stays in the
  pipeline as the envelope/reconstruction engine (M2's sibling subtraction
  already relies on it).

**Note (fly124): our trajectory explains the audio BETTER than the telemetry
does** (0.5300 vs 0.5498). Suggestive that the 29 Hz telemetry label carries
error we are being scored against — but not conclusive, since our trajectory
is *fitted* to the audio while the telemetry is independent. Clean follow-up:
check whether a smoothed telemetry track fits the audio better than the raw
one; if so, the label noise floor is real and must be quoted with any
"much better on Michael's" claim.

**Next design step (from the user's question):** rather than deleting the
frequency update, replace its estimator — `_freq_update`'s Fisher-weighted
phase slopes + pentadiagonal solve is the same estimator family as pi_kalman
but cruder. The synthesis worth building is **pi_kalman's estimator running on
VK envelopes** instead of on brickwall demod: VK's coupled banded LS (coupling
groups + Tůma bandwidth) separates *close* harmonics better than a brickwall
band, which is exactly the twin-collision starvation WP1-B identified as
pi_kalman's binding constraint on real windows.

## WP6 — `refine_v2` measured; the bottleneck MOVES upstream (2026-07-31)

`refine_v2` (ladder+capture → M1 ±8@0.25×3 → M1 ±4@0.1×2 → ONE M2-solo →
stop) is now in `scripts/rps_refine_lab.py`, with `synthbl*` (physically
band-limited) windows and a per-window `oracle_floor`. Pooled final PIT-MAE:

| group | baseline | alt_loop | refine_v2 | v2 (1 M1 round) | oracle |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| synth_trace | 1.038 | 0.752 | 0.753 | **0.711** | 0.397 |
| synth battery (6) | 2.893 | 2.639 | **2.542** | 2.568 | 0.952 |
| synthbl battery (6) | 2.389 | 2.268 | 2.076 | **2.067** | 0.697 |
| real (2) | 2.205 | 2.254 | 2.170 | **2.163** | — |
| all 15 | 2.476 | 2.314 | **2.187** | 2.190 | 0.792 |

- vs baseline: −12% pooled at **0.78× the runtime** (dropping the inert refine
  rounds pays for the new stages), 11 wins / 2 losses / 2 ties.
- vs alt_loop: −0.127 pooled at **0.36× runtime**. alt_loop is *worse than
  baseline* on the real pair — its rounds 2-4 + polish degrade a converged
  track exactly as WP4 predicted.
- Structural win where it matters: on the real pair std-ratio 0.772 → **0.954**
  and shape-corr 0.645 → **0.717** — the WP3 "per-rotor deviation is
  unrepresented" defect is largely fixed.
- "Iteration is harmful" extends to the M1 rounds themselves (round 2 is
  another estimator application); 1-round is better on 9/15 windows and
  strictly better on both real windows. Treat `--v2-rounds 1` as the default
  for real data.
- **Sub-bin corridor scoring: not a lever** (−0.030 mean, sign flips per
  window). `_norm_smooth` + the Viterbi transition cost already smooth over
  the 7.8 Hz bin; the corridor's resolution limit is comb *contrast*, not the
  sampling grid.

### The bottleneck is no longer refinement

The oracle floor is **0.792 pooled vs refine_v2's 2.190 — 2.8×** — but that
gap is *not* sibling interference: 3 of 13 windows (synth01, synth02,
synthbl02) have oracle floors of 1.2-2.1, i.e. their entry tracks already
contain a **wholly mis-assigned rotor**, which perfect sibling removal cannot
repair. The battery mean is failure-dominated. Contrast synth_trace, where the
entry is sound: oracle 0.397 vs 0.711 = 1.8×, genuinely a refinement gap.

`synthbl_hi` (20 dB) sharpens it: on 4/6 windows the oracle floor is
0.126-0.393 against a blind 1.056-2.803 — at good SNR sibling removal is worth
~10× and the blind chain leaves nearly all of it unclaimed. The other 2/6
windows collapse to ~40 rev/s for chain *and* oracle: a seed-stage
octave/subharmonic failure that appears **only** at high SNR (the comb then
dominates the whitened spectrum and the octave check mis-fires).

**Conclusion: further refinement work has low marginal value until capture is
fixed.** Priorities now — (WP7) blind-seed / ladder rotor mis-assignment: the
seeder returns duplicate/twin bases and misses a distinct rotor, and nothing
downstream can invent it. Lever: *residual re-seeding generalized* — subtract
all four tracked combs, scan the residual for an unexplained comb, and
reassign the worst-fitting rotor to it (the lab's `run_reseed` already does the
single comb-invisible-rotor case). (WP8) the high-SNR octave failure.

## WP9 — vs the IAVKF paper: why theirs works and our refine did not (2026-07-31)

Reference: Li, Han & Wang, *"Research on a Signal Separation Method Based on
Vold-Kalman Filter of Improved Adaptive Instantaneous Frequency Estimation"*,
IEEE Access 2020 (DOI 10.1109/access.2020.3002999; in the library, fulltext).

**They do not do what our refine stage does.** Their "adaptive IF estimation"
is *external* to VK: synchrosqueezed wavelet transform → adaptive multiridge
extraction with peak detection → the resulting IF is fed to VK as a **given
parameter**. There is no iterative in-band phase-slope correction of the IF.
A TF-ridge estimator has essentially unlimited capture range (it finds the
ridge wherever it sits in the plane); our `_freq_update` is a *local*
narrowband correction whose capture range is ±bw/(2k) — 0.125 rev/s at the
refine stage. So the two results do not conflict: they report that **VK
separates well when handed a good IF**, which we independently confirm (WP5:
envelopes improve monotonically with trajectory quality).

**Phase noise is NOT the cause — measured and refuted**
(`refine-diagnosis/comb_capture2.py`). Synthetic built with comb and noise
kept separate, VK run with the EXACT trajectory, sweeping shaft jitter:

| jitter (per-rotor rps std) | comb captured @ bw 1.5 Hz | @ 0.5 Hz |
|---|---|---|
| ×0.2 (0.46 rev/s) | 100.0% | 100.0% |
| ×1.0 (2.30 rev/s) | 100.0% | 100.0% |
| ×3.0 (6.90 rev/s) | 100.0% | 100.0% |
| ×1.0 at 0 dB SNR | 97.6% | 99.1% |

Jitter is irrelevant because **VK demodulates *along the trajectory*** (phase
k·∫r dt): correct demodulation removes the FM by construction, so the line is
narrow in the envelope domain no matter how much the shaft wanders. Phase
noise would bite only if we demodulated at a *constant* frequency. The refine
stage's failure is therefore purely capture range (WP1), not linewidth.

**Corollary — a label-error probe.** On FLY124, demodulating along the
*telemetry* GT captures only 36.5% of the recording at bw 1.5 Hz but 67.7% at
bw 5 Hz. Since jitter provably does not widen the line, that shortfall is
residual FM = **error in the telemetry itself**. Independent corroboration of
WP5's observation that our estimated trajectory explains the audio better than
the telemetry does. Quantifying this label floor is a prerequisite for any
"much better on Michael's data" claim.

**Architectural convergence.** IAVKF's wide-capture external IF estimator
feeding VK is structurally the same move as our M1 residual corridor Viterbi
feeding M2 — arrived at independently, from the opposite direction. Their
choice of SWT ridges over our comb-corridor DP is worth a comparison: ridges
are single-component and would need the sibling masking we already built.

## WP7 — the mis-assignment is a SEEDER artefact; M3 repairs half of it (2026-07-31)

### (a) Diagnosis — `split_nudge` duplicates, not octave errors

The entry tracks of the failure windows are wrong because `blind_seed`'s arm R
**deliberately duplicates a base** when it cannot find a 4th distinct comb:

```python
seeds_r.append(anchor + sign * cfg.split_nudge * ((cycle + 1) // 2))   # split_nudge = 0.1
```

18 of the 21 lab windows (battery + real) carry at least one seed pair exactly
0.1 rev/s apart — the fingerprint of that line. Only `synth_trace` and
`synthblhi04` are clean, and `synth_trace` is precisely the window WP6 found to
have a sound entry. Per-window (GT = realized 16 s means, not the configured
OU means):

| window | GT means | seed bases | duplicate pair | unseeded true rotor | class | oracle |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| synth01 | 72.81 80.87 83.53 86.03 | 72.25 **72.35** 81.4 86.4 | 72.25/72.35 | 83.53 (2.1 from nearest) | duplicate-seed + missing-comb | 1.242 |
| synth02 | 71.02 77.85 79.27 82.62 | 77.15 **77.25** 80.0 **80.1** | ×2 | 71.02, 82.62 | double duplicate-seed | 2.109 |
| synthbl02 | 71.01 77.85 79.25 82.62 | 77.2 **77.3** 80.05 **80.15** | ×2 | 71.01, 82.62 | double duplicate-seed | 1.614 |
| synth04 (control) | 79.76 83.50 90.33 93.21 | 79.3 **79.4** 88.85 93.6 | 79.3/79.4 | 83.50 (4.1) | duplicate-seed, recoverable | 0.470 |
| synthbl03 (control) | 71.18 80.34 84.18 87.26 | 70.8 80.75 84.15 **84.25** | 84.15/84.25 | 87.26 (3.0) | duplicate-seed, recoverable | 0.237 |

**No octave errors and no swaps at 0 dB** — the defect is uniformly
duplicate-seed → missing-comb. The "controls" have the *same* defect; they
differ only in that the mis-assignment stays inside the oracle M2's capture
radius (band 12 Hz at k=1..4 admits 3-4 rev/s), so perfect sibling removal
recovers them and the oracle floor looks healthy.

The error is **unrecoverable from `seed` onwards**: per-stage biases move by
<1 rev/s through `coarse_init → viterbi_c → vit2dsp → capture → M1`, and the
big bias never shrinks (synth01: -8.5 at seed, -7.6 after capture, -7.9 after
M1). Nothing downstream invents a comb.

Why arm R fails: `residual_rescan` requires a new comb to be `>= dedup_rps =
4.0` rev/s from every used base, on a *static, time-averaged* masked spectrum.
The missing rotor is 2.1-3.0 rev/s from a used base in synth01/synthbl03/
synth02 — structurally inadmissible. Re-running `blind_seed` with diagnostics
confirms it: `residual_new = []` for synth02/synthbl02, and in 4 of 5 windows
the true base was *already in the accepted candidate list* (synth02's 70.6 and
82.7, synth04's 84.4, synthbl03's 87.55 at a score comparable to the kept
70.8) and was discarded in favour of duplicating the loudest peaks.

**Upstream lever (WP8 candidate, not taken here):** at cruise a quadrotor's
rotors sit 2-3 rev/s apart, so `dedup_rps = 4.0` forbids resolving them by
construction. Lowering it (or preferring an accepted distinct candidate over a
`split_nudge` duplicate) is a one-line change with battery-wide reach.

### (b) M3 — residual re-seed, generalized (`refine_v3`)

`ladder(capture) → M3 → M1 → M2-solo`. Per iteration (max 3):

1. reconstruct **all four** combs (`vk_envelopes`+`vk_reconstruct`, RECON_CFG)
   and subtract; abort if resid/orig > 1.0 (the dregon cancelling mode);
2. comb-scan the 8192-pt whitened residual (`_reseed_scan_scores`, k=1..12,
   0.05 rev/s grid, on-teeth minus half-teeth) → top-6 peaks with robust z;
3. filter: loose z >= 1.5, >= **2.0 rev/s** from every current track, not a
   p/q ∈ {2,3,4} multiple/submultiple of a track (±1.0), and inside a 1.30
   rotor-band span;
4. the rotor to reassign = **least unique energy explained**, from a *re-fitted*
   leave-one-out residual. Surface quality cannot see duplicates (a duplicate
   sits on a genuine comb and scores well); the removal test can — a duplicate's
   comb is still explained by its twin, so its removal is nearly free
   (synth00: gains 0.081/0.066/**0.008/0.007** for the twin pair);
5. **verify, don't trust the scan**: corridor-track the top 3 proposals on the
   sibling residual (±8@0.25 then ±2@0.1) and keep the one that most reduces the
   4-comb residual, requiring a drop >= max(0.008, 0.25 × median of the other
   rotors' leave-one-out gains).

Design decisions and the measurements behind them:

- **z is a proposer, not a gate.** At the ladder exit the genuinely missing
  rotor scores z = 1.8-3.1 in the residual while comb-residue ridges reach
  3.5-4.0; the seeder's z >= 3.0 both admits junk and rejects the truth.
  Verification by residual drop picks the right comb in synth01 even though it
  was the *lowest*-z of the three proposals (drops 0.019/0.024/**0.027**).
- **The drop threshold is adaptive** because a real repair drops the residual
  by 0.027-0.040 while the spurious combs later iterations keep proposing drop
  it by 0.003-0.006 — an order of magnitude, referenced to the ~0.05-0.08 a
  genuinely-owned rotor contributes.
- **`MIN_SEP = 2.0`, not 1.5.** 1.5 let FLY124 re-seed onto its 93.1 residual
  peak against a track the ladder had dragged to 91.16: two tracks on one
  strong comb, which the coupled VK solve *rewards* (near-degenerate pairs
  cancel, residual drops 0.032) while PIT-MAE collapses 1.13 → 4.80. 2.0 is the
  minimum pairwise rotor separation the battery generator itself assumes.
- **Rotor-band span 1.30.** With the two genuine proposals filtered out, the
  verifier happily took a 66 rev/s noise ridge against tracks at 87-96
  (synth00, 20.4 rev/s error): *any* extra comb with freely fitted VK envelopes
  absorbs some residual energy, so the drop test alone is not self-limiting.
- **No post-track duplicate guard.** Rejecting a repair that lands near a
  sibling was tried and reverted: it killed synth01's correct repair (1.50 gap)
  and synth00's (0.18 gap). M1's sibling-masked coordinate descent is the
  mechanism that separates co-located tracks; that is its job, not M3's.

### (c) Measured, `--v2-rounds 1` throughout (WP6 default)

| group | refine_v2 | refine_v3 | Δ | v2 oracle | v3 oracle | v2 s/win | v3 s/win |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| synth battery (6) | 2.568 | **2.179** | −0.389 | 0.953 | 0.899 | 62 | 83 |
| synthbl battery (6) | 2.067 | **1.742** | −0.325 | 0.695 | 0.827 | 65 | 83 |
| synth_trace | 0.711 | 0.711 | 0.000 | 0.372 | 0.372 | 70 | 52 |
| real (2) | 2.163 | 2.163 | 0.000 | — | — | 136 | 102 |
| **all 15** | **2.190** | **1.904** | **−0.286** | 0.790 | 0.825 | 73 | 83 |

| synthbl_hi (4 non-collapsed) | 1.820 | 1.713 | −0.107 | 0.202 | 0.211 | 34 | 62 |

7 wins / 4 losses / 4 ties over the 15. M3 fires on 13 of 21 windows and
**no-ops on every window that does not need it**: `synth_trace` and both real
windows come back bit-identical (dregon aborts at the recon guard, ratio 110.9;
fly124 stops on the drop test). Of the three WP6 failure windows:

| window | v2 final | v3 final | v2 oracle | v3 oracle | repaired? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| synth01 | 3.168 | **1.340** | 1.242 | **0.585** | yes — both halve |
| synth02 | 3.942 | 4.162 | 2.109 | 2.341 | no |
| synthbl02 | 3.556 | 3.776 | 1.614 | 2.439 | no |

The wins came from windows WP6 did *not* flag, whose duplicate seeds the
oracle had been silently covering: synth00 2.570→1.676, synthbl00 2.177→1.441,
synthbl03 1.348→0.803, synthbl04 1.547→1.021, synthbl05 2.724→2.278.

**seed 102 (synth02/synthbl02) is the residual failure and is structural:** its
two closest true rotors are 1.42 rev/s apart — *below* the 2.0 rev/s separation
both the design and the battery generator assume distinct rotors have — so
every correct proposal is excluded by the MIN_SEP guard, and at aggressiveness
1.4 (per-rotor std 3-4 rev/s) the trajectories cross constantly. It also needs
TWO repairs. Relaxing MIN_SEP to 1.5 recovers it (3.164) but costs FLY124
1.13 → 4.80; the real window wins.

The pooled oracle floor is essentially unchanged (0.790 → 0.825) even though
the chain improved 13%: M3 moves tracks *toward* the truth in a way the oracle
was already able to fake on the recoverable windows, so the remaining
chain-vs-oracle gap (1.904 vs 0.825, 2.3×) is now much more genuinely a
refinement gap than it was at WP6 (2.190 vs 0.790, 2.8×, failure-dominated).

**Cost:** +14% wall on the 15-window set (73 → 83 s/window); ~8 VK envelope
re-fits per M3 iteration (1 full + 4 leave-one-out + up to 3 verification).

## WP8 — the seeder knobs: `dedup_rps` is safe, promotion is not (2026-07-31)

WP7(a)'s "one-line change with battery-wide reach" implemented and measured.
Two `SeedConfig` knobs, both **default-preserving** (verified bit-identical
seeds vs the old code on both real windows, and `chain=baseline` still PASSes
all four trace references 3.262/3.214, 1.148/1.140):

- `dedup_rps` (existing, 4.0): with arms `{"K","R"}` it only gates arm R's
  residual re-scan — how far a NEW comb must sit from every used base.
- `prefer_distinct_candidate` (new, False) + `min_sep_rps` (2.0),
  `promote_z_min` (2.0), `promote_span` (1.30): when a slot would be filled
  with a `split_nudge` duplicate, promote the best *accepted distinct*
  candidate instead. The last two guards are measured necessities — unguarded
  promotion takes a 113.6 rev/s ridge on synth01 and 102.6 on FLY124.

### Seed-stage sweep (21 lab windows, `blind_seed` only, arms `{"R"}`)

Metrics: mean sorted-assignment |seed − true 16 s mean| (`pit_mae`), Σ seed
pairs < 0.5 rev/s apart (`dups`), Σ true rotors with no seed within 2 rev/s.

| config | pit_mae | dups | unseeded | vs default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| dedup 4.0, off (**shipped**) | 2.566 | 24 | 28 | — |
| dedup 3.0, off | 2.566 | 24 | 28 | identical (no candidate in 3-4) |
| dedup 2.5, off | 2.373 | 21 | 26 | 2 wins / 1 loss |
| dedup 2.0, off | 2.472 | 19 | 26 | **FLY124 collapses 1.23 → 4.70** |
| dedup 1.5, off | 2.472 | 19 | 26 | same collapse |
| dedup 4.0, promote | 1.945 | 12 | 20 | 11 wins / 0 losses |
| **dedup 2.5, promote** | **1.722** | **10** | 19 | **13 wins / 0 losses** |
| dedup 2.5, promote, min_sep 1.5 | 1.657 | 8 | 19 | 14 wins / 0 losses |
| dedup 2.5, promote, z 1.0 | 1.772 | 5 | **17** | 13 wins / 2 losses |

`dedup_rps <= 2.0` reproduces the WP7 MIN_SEP failure **at the seeder**:
FLY124's residual scan then admits a 90.35 comb 2.0 rev/s from the 92.35 base
— two seeds on one comb, exactly the mode that cost M3 1.13 → 4.80.

### End-to-end (`--v2-rounds 1`; "dd" = `dedup_rps 2.5` only)

| group | v2 def | v2 dd | v2 both | v3 def | v3 dd | v3 both | orc v3 def | orc v3 both |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| synth battery (6) | 2.568 | 2.191 | **1.870** | 2.179 | 2.211 | **1.680** | 0.899 | 0.729 |
| synthbl battery (6) | 2.067 | 2.067 | **1.765** | 1.742 | 1.742 | **1.654** | 0.827 | 0.626 |
| synth_trace | 0.711 | 0.711 | 0.711 | 0.711 | 0.711 | 0.711 | 0.372 | 0.372 |
| real (2) | 2.163 | 2.163 | 2.163 | 2.163 | 2.163 | 2.163 | — | — |
| **all 15** | 2.190 | 2.039 | **1.790** | 1.904 | 1.917 | **1.669** | 0.825 | **0.654** |
| synthbl_hi (4 non-collapsed) | 1.820 | 1.233 | **1.131** | 1.713 | 1.282 | **1.138** | 0.211 | 0.251 |

v2: 7 wins / 1 loss (+0.08) / 7 ties; v3: 5 wins / 3 losses / 7 ties. The
oracle floor drops with the chain (0.825 → 0.654), i.e. the *entry* really is
better, not just the refinement. Seed 102 (synth02/synthbl02), WP7's
"structural" residual failure, finally moves: v3 4.162 → 2.826 and 3.776 →
2.671, oracle 2.341 → 1.254 — the promoted 82.7 comb is one of its two needed
repairs. Cost: none (v2 52.9 s/window vs 73.4 default; v3 81.7 vs 83.2).

### Why the production default must NOT flip to promotion

Checked at the seed stage on **all 15 cached beatvk real windows** (FLY124
w00-w05 + the three DREGON recordings' w00-w02):

- `dedup_rps = 2.5` alone: **bit-identical seeds on all 15**. Safe.
- promotion on: changes 2 of 15, both for the worse —
  `free-flight_nosource_room1` **w02** 0.56 → 2.37 seed MAE, and end-to-end on
  the production `baseline` chain **1.019 → 4.487**.

Mechanism: DREGON at cruise really is two tight twin pairs (74.8/75.4 and
84.9/86.2), so the `split_nudge` duplicate is the *physically correct* seed and
the "distinct comb" (77.5 rev/s, z 2.25) is junk. Contrast cannot separate the
cases — the good synth02 promotion sits at z 2.57, the bad DREGON one at 2.25.
This is WP7's own lesson restated: **z is a proposer, not a gate**, and the only
working acceptance test is M3's — track the candidate and check the residual
drops. That test needs trajectories, which the seeder does not have.

→ Recommendation: ship `dedup_rps = 2.5` (all-15 v2 2.190 → 2.039, zero real
change); keep `prefer_distinct_candidate = False` as the default and use it for
synthetic/lab work. The real prize (all-15 1.669) needs the promotion to be
*verified* — the natural next step is to let M3 propose from the seeder's
discarded accepted candidates, where the residual-drop test can adjudicate.
FLY124 is untouched by either knob: its missing rotor is 1.2-2.0 rev/s from a
used base and has no accepted candidate at all, so "much better on Michael's"
does not come from here.

## WP12 — M3 made safe, and FLY124 w05 recovered (2026-07-31)

**The M3 regression had two real causes, both worth remembering.**
(1) *Leave-one-out gain cannot distinguish a duplicate seed from a genuine
tight twin* — FLY124 cruise really is `[73.96, 74.85, 80.73, 90.79]`, so the
74/75 pair each look "redundant" (the sibling covers the same teeth). M3
declared a correctly-held track spare. (2) *The residual-drop test is not
self-limiting*: a proposal tracked to 1.94 rev/s from an existing track — same
comb — and the coupled VK solve **rewards** that (near-degenerate pairs
cancel), drop 0.036 vs `min_drop` 0.008. w04 1.087 → 4.743. A third variant
appeared on w02: LOO gains go *negative* for a genuine collapsed pair and the
objective prefers vacating it over the actually-spare pair.

Fix = three changes: **Gate A** (redundancy — fire only if some track's LOO
gain is ≤0 or ≤0.50× the median of the others; duplicates sit at 0.11–0.25 of
it, FLY124's genuine twins at 0.53–0.70); **Gate B** (multiplicity — stop if
the ≤2.0 rev/s neighbour graph has more than one disjoint degenerate group,
since one verified move cannot rank two independent repairs); and a **verified
search over (rotor × proposal)** where LOO only *orders* candidates and the
residual test chooses both the vacated track and its destination.

Result: v3 ≡ v2 on **all six** FLY124 windows (M3 now no-ops on each, at four
different gates), and the synthetic pooled improves to **1.817** (vs WP7's
1.904) — 7 wins / 1 loss / 7 ties, with WP7's synth02/synthbl02 losses
removed. *Fragility to watch: Gate A's margin is thin — w04's minimum is 0.53
against the 0.50 threshold.*

**Cross-window seeding recovers w05: 3.380 → 1.147** (per-rotor 0.72/1.18/
1.57/1.12), putting it in the same band as w03 (1.130) and w04 (1.087).
Bases corroborated by ≥2 other cruise windows of the same recording become
extra proposals. Pooling alone was NOT enough: the drop test picked the wrong
rotor, because correctly placing a track on the comb-invisible 81 rev/s rotor
is worth ~10× *less* residual than mis-placing one beside the strong 91 comb —
the audio can adjudicate the *base* but not the *rotor*. So in the pool branch
the mover is chosen by **cross-window rank evidence** (sorted rank r is stable
at cruise) and the audio only has to not contradict.

Three assumptions, all required, all off by default (`--m3-pool`/`--m3-ref`):
same recording + cruise + near-constant speeds; **sorted-rank identity stable
across windows** (a majority vote — it would have named the wrong rotor on w04,
which is protected only by Gate A); corroboration by ≥2 windows (this is what
stops w02's mis-tracked 72.1 base contaminating w03/w04). w02 is *not*
recovered — its audio actively contradicts the repair, and it is the
takeoff→cruise transition window (GT std 7.4/3.4/3.6/3.8 vs 1.2–2.1).

**FLY124 label lag, measured (feeds WP11):** w02 −61.83, w03 −49.00, w04
−34.61, w05 −31.77 ms (w00/w01 diverge, skipped). OLS vs window-centre time:
**+0.654 ms/s · t − 86.1 ms, R² 0.94**, residual RMS 2.9 ms vs 12.0 ms for a
constant-lag model → dilation confirmed; implied multiplier ×1.000654 on the
shipped 1.001.

## WP11 — Michael's telemetry calibration, packaged for the cluster (2026-07-31)

`scripts/michaels_calib/` is the repo-ified version of the scratchpad probe, so
the full sweep runs in ONE CPU job instead of hand-driven local windows:

- `windows.py` — replays the frozen beat-VK windowing protocol against the raw
  recordings, for FLY125 too (it is the *training* recording and is not in
  `beatvk-valid-raw`). Data root = `$DATA_ROOT` → `<repo>/data` → dload
  `recording_with_motor_speed` via `streams.ensure_local`, so it runs on any
  backend. `selfcheck()` proves the rebuild is bit-identical to the frozen
  FLY124 prep cache when that cache is present.
- `calib.py` — referee (VK recon residual ratio under `RECON_CFG`, k 1..30 —
  the same one-liner as `rps_refine_lab.RECON_CFG`) + the four stages
  `lag` / `val` / `prot` / `post`.
- `fit.py` — lag-vs-time OLS → proposed `time_offset` / `time_dilation`, and
  the additive-vs-multiplicative verdicts.
- `run_sweep.py` — the driver: prep cache once in the parent, then one process
  per (window, stage[, rotor]); restartable (skips units whose JSON exists);
  writes `results/michaels_calib/{manifest,summary}.json` + `raw/*.json`.

Sweep contents: FLY125 lag scan on **every** cruise window + the regression;
FLY124 lag on w03/w04 only, scored against the WP12 numbers above (a
confirmation, not a re-derivation); and, for both recordings, the
additive-vs-multiplicative rev/s test — `val` (matched families, `g = b/80`)
plus the per-rotor `prot` discriminator, which carries the leverage: additive
⇒ the per-rotor optimum is independent of that rotor's mean rps,
multiplicative ⇒ proportional to it (cruise spans 74–91 rev/s, a 23 % spread).

`src/data_processing/michaels.py` is deliberately **untouched** — applying the
correction comes after the calibration lands.

## WP13 — the calibration measured, and APPLIED to the loader (2026-07-31)

Sweep result: `omnirun-outputs/python-519b66/results/michaels_calib/summary.json`
(959 s wall, 16 cores, `uni-cpu`). Referee = the label-free VK reconstruction
residual; only the telemetry is moved.

### Timing — BOTH recordings have a clock-rate (dilation) error

| recording | cruise windows | lag range | OLS slope | intercept | R² | resid RMS | vs constant-lag |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FLY124 | 4 (w02–w05, centres 40/56/72/88 s) | −61.83 → −31.77 ms | **+0.65356 ms/s** | −86.131 ms | 0.942 | 2.90 ms | 12.04 ms |
| FLY125 | 9 (w01–w09, centres 24–152 s) | −158.35 → −105.54 ms | **+0.37656 ms/s** | −172.086 ms | 0.923 | 4.49 ms | 16.19 ms |

Both are dilation, not offset: the linear fit beats the constant-lag model by
4.1× / 3.6× in residual RMS. FLY124's four lags are WP12's; the cluster job
re-measured w03/w04 independently at −48.51 / −34.56 ms (vs −49.00 / −34.61),
i.e. within 0.5 ms, so the two derivations are the same measurement.

**The algebra** (`scripts/michaels_calib/fit.py:fit_lag`, applied identically to
both recordings). With the old constants the audio prefers the telemetry shifted
by `lag(t) = a + b·t` seconds. The loader maps a raw telemetry stamp τ to
audio-frame time as `W = d·τ + (ts_raw[0] − time_offset)`, so absorbing the
drift means

```
time_dilation_new = time_dilation_old / (1 − b)
time_offset_new   = time_offset_old  − a / (1 − b)
```

FLY124 (b = 6.5356e−4 s/s, a = −0.086131 s, old = (−20.84, 1.001)):

```
1/(1−b)        = 1.00065399
time_dilation  = 1.001   / 0.99934644 = 1.001654644
time_offset    = −20.84 − (−0.086131)/0.99934644 = −20.84 + 0.086187 = −20.753813
```

FLY125 (b = 3.7656e−4 s/s, a = −0.172086 s, old = (−26.51, 1.0048)):

```
1/(1−b)        = 1.000376701
time_dilation  = 1.0048 / 0.99962344 = 1.005178509
time_offset    = −26.51 − (−0.172086)/0.99962344 = −26.51 + 0.172151 = −26.337849
```

### Value — a real ~+0.6 rev/s deficit, of an UNRESOLVED functional form

Telemetry is LOW at cruise on both recordings (DREGON is biased the other way,
so this is a rig property, not a referee bias). The additive-vs-multiplicative
discriminator (`prot`: per-rotor optimal offset regressed on that rotor's own
mean rps, over the 74–91 rev/s cruise spread) is **inconclusive**:

| recording | additive RMS | multiplicative RMS | verdict | margin | free-line R² | predicted spread | observed spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FLY124 | 0.2939 (b = 0.6796) | 0.30557 (g = 0.008387) | additive | 4 % | 0.013 | 0.147 | 0.938 |
| FLY125 | 0.38621 (b = 0.5545) | 0.38607 (g = 0.006904) | multiplicative | 0.04 % | 0.004 | 0.117 | 1.964 |

The two recordings return opposite verdicts, one of them by 0.04 % — a tie. The
free lines explain ~1 % of the variance, and the observed per-rotor spread is
6–17× what *either* model predicts, i.e. the per-rotor optima are dominated by
something else (per-rotor acoustic strength / tracking) and the test has no
statistical power. The matched `val` comparison agrees it cannot separate them
(mean Δ ≈ −3e−4 residual, both families reaching ~0.52).

**Resolved on physical grounds, not statistics: MULTIPLICATIVE.** The two forms
are indistinguishable in the cruise band where they were measured, but the
published frames span the WHOLE recording — ground idle, warm-up, spin-down. An
additive +0.6 rev/s would corrupt a near-stationary rotor's label and
manufacture harmonics at a standstill; a scale correctly vanishes as rps → 0.
Shipped at the time: FLY124 ×1.00839, FLY125 ×1.00690 (+0.671 / +0.552 rev/s at

### Applied

`src/data_processing/michaels.py`: `MICHAELS_FILES` carries the new
offset/dilation pairs, and a new `MICHAELS_RPS_SCALE` (keyed by CSV stem, with
`rps_scale_for()`) is applied inside `_load_michaels_data_raw`, so **every**
consumer of the loader — `load_michaels_timeframe(s)`, `publish_frame_datasets`,
`create_dregon_librimix`, the online-mix `michaels` source, `vk_blind_sweep`,
`scripts/michaels_calib/windows.py` — gets calibrated labels with no call-site
change. Unknown recordings (the 103 unaligned `new-drone-noises` logs) fall back
to 1.0. `michaels-frames` was republished on top of this; its per-recording
`meta` now records `rps_scale` plus a `provenance.calibration` note, and the raw
`Motor:Speed:*` CSV columns remain **uncalibrated** in the `motor_speed` block
(the same fixed/raw pairing DREGON has with `motors_command_raw`).

Known bypass paths (read the CSV directly, so they never see the scale):
`writing/reports/2026-06-30_synthetic-rps-trajectories/prepare.py` (RC-stick
figure, no rps), the `motor_speed` block above, and
`notebooks/michael_data_analysis.ipynb` (which still hardcodes the OLD
`-20.84/1.001` and `-26.51/1.0048` — it is the historical origin of the
hand-tuned pair, left as a record).

### Validation — the correction closes the gap (job `python-0445f6`, 596 s)

`run_sweep.py --post-shipped` re-runs the `post` stage (residual lag + residual
global offset) on every cruise window of both recordings, rebuilt with whatever
`michaels.py` now ships. Results
(`omnirun-outputs/python-0445f6/results/michaels_calib_post/summary.json`,
13 windows, no edge hits):

| recording | n | resid lag mean | resid lag RMS | resid lag max | resid b mean | resid b max | (was) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FLY124 | 4 | −2.47 ms | 2.98 ms | 3.95 ms | −0.178 rev/s | 0.239 | lag −62…−32 ms, b +0.68 |
| FLY125 | 9 | +1.27 ms | 3.29 ms | 8.35 ms | +0.004 rev/s | 0.107 | lag −158…−106 ms, b +0.55 |

Timing is closed on both: the residual lag RMS (3.0 / 3.3 ms) is at the level of
the fit's own residual (2.9 / 4.5 ms), i.e. the dilation model absorbed the whole
drift, and the systematic per-window trend is gone (FLY124 w02→w05 residuals
+0.28/−3.95/−3.64/−2.55 ms, no monotone drift; FLY125 spans ±8 ms with no slope).

FLY125's value error is closed exactly (mean +0.004 rev/s). **FLY124 is left
~0.18 rev/s over-corrected** — consistent by construction: the shipped scale came
from the per-rotor `prot` mean (0.680 at cruise), whereas the global-offset scans
(`val` on w03/w04: 0.513 / 0.608) preferred ~0.56. The gap, 0.1–0.2 rev/s, is
well inside the 0.94 rev/s per-rotor spread that made the additive/multiplicative
test powerless in the first place, and is ~5× smaller than the error it removed
— not worth a second fit on the same four windows. Flagged, not chased.

> **Chased anyway, in WP14** — the 13-window sweep was run for the per-rotor
> question and re-measured the global gain for free. The flag was right:
> FLY124's scale is 0.14 pp too high. Both scales are now refit (see WP14
> § "Applied"); `python-b7e225` is the `--post-shipped` re-validation on the
> corrected labels.

`windows.selfcheck()` now rebuilds explicitly at `FROZEN_BEATVK_CONSTANTS`
(−20.84, 1.001, scale 1.0), since the frozen beat-VK prep cache predates the
calibration and can no longer match the shipped constants by construction.

### Stale artefacts (blast radius — NOTHING regenerated here)

Everything built from Michael's telemetry before `michaels-frames@a7a951b94808`
carries labels late by 31–158 ms and low by ~0.55–0.67 rev/s at cruise. (WP14
later republished as `fdef818432e9` with the refitted rev/s scales — a further
−0.11 rev/s on FLY124 / +0.013 rev/s on FLY125 at cruise. Anything rebuilt
against `a7a951b94808` is *nearly* current; anything older is not.)

| artefact | how stale | to rebuild |
|---|---|---|
| ~~`beatvk-valid-raw` (dload pin `268c7660`)~~ **DONE** | republished as **`@54849c13ed3a`** and pinned. Window boundaries and count did NOT move (FLY124 still 6 windows tiling [0,96) s; DREGON bit-identical); the FLY124 *audio* did — the new `time_offset` trims 86.188 ms less off the WAV head | done: `python scripts/publish_beatvk_valid.py` + `dload pin` |
| ~~`results/beatvk_vk_arms/`~~ **DONE (prep cache)** | rebuilt at `@54849c13`; the pre-recalibration copy is kept at `results/beatvk_vk_arms_pre_recalib_268c7660/` (and the stale default seed cache at `results/rps_refine_lab/seed_cache_pre_recalib_268c7660/`). The `runs/` + per-arm NPZs of `beatvk_vk_arms.py` itself were NOT re-run — only the prep cache the lab chains read | `scripts/beatvk_rescore.py` rebuilds it; re-run `beatvk_vk_arms.py` if the blind/neural/telem arms are needed |
| ~~`docs/experiments/beat-vk.md` scoreboard~~ **DONE** | re-scored on the corrected protocol (jobs `python-7553a8`, `python-764ca5`); pre- and post-recalibration columns both kept. **The FLY124 regression is a blind-seeding flip, not the labels**: the 86 ms realignment loses w03's comb-invisible 82.7 rev/s rotor, and with that seed held fixed the correction *improves* FLY124 cruise 2.644 → 2.421. The **1.027 bar is a DIFFERENT protocol** (20 s `vk_blind_sweep` r6) and is still stale | re-run `vk_blind_sweep` for the 1.027 bar |
| `writing/papers/2026-07_coupled-vk-blind-rps/main.tex` | the FLY124 columns/rows (1.027, 1.016 → 0.859, the w0–w2 table) and the prose around them | after re-scoring |
| `scripts/rps_predictor_vk_eval.py` (`michaels_FLY124` rows of the hardcoded per-sample table, ~L232–246) | baked GT means/stds from old labels (e.g. cruise 80.374 → ≈ 81.0) | regenerate the table |
| `DREGON-LM-V4-michaels-{train,valid,valid-full}` | offline `rps.npy` baked from the loader. Local copy: **1552 / 9000 train** samples are `michaels_FLY125`; the local valid splits are DREGON-only, but the *published* pins may differ — verify before relying on that | `scripts/create_dregon_librimix.py` (canonical command in `data_processing/AGENTS.md`) |
| online-mix policies using `kind: michaels` / `kind: frames + michaels-frames` (`g1_*`, `g3_gp_aug`, `g5`, `g6`, `g7_ramp`, `e9_real_ft*`, `e12_*`, `beatvk_avq_dload`, `online_mix_v4_michaels_timewarp*`, …) | none pins an explicit `version:`, so they follow `dload.lock` and pick the corrected frames up **automatically** — i.e. models trained before this pin were trained on different labels | nothing to change; note the discontinuity |
| GP egonoise `matrice100` checkpoint (`r2://ml-data/artifacts/gp_egonoise/matrice100`) + the noise generators' michaels codebook entries | fitted against old labels (rps → spectrum mapping shifted by ~0.6 rev/s) | retrain if the ~0.8 % rps shift matters |

Believed **unaffected**: DREGON-only results, `AVQ-egonoise-vkrps` (blind
pseudo-labels from AVQ audio, no michaels telemetry in the product — but the
annotator's *validation* numbers on FLY124 are stale), and every michaels
*audio* artefact (audio itself never changed, only the label clock/scale).


### WP10 addendum — the anti-circularity controls (were measured, not recorded here)

The FLY124 label study ran controls that this document failed to carry over, so
a later reader (and the paper draft) could not cite them. Recording them now.
Referee = VK reconstruction residual, lower = explains the audio better; raw
telemetry baseline in the first row.

| test | what it rules out | fly124_w03 | fly124_w04 | dregon_ns_w02 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `raw` | — | 0.5498 | 0.5506 | 0.6341 |
| `rnd0..3` random offsets, same RMS | "any perturbation that size helps" | 0.5510 / 0.5511 / 0.5606 / 0.5713 — **all worse than raw** | 0.5500 / 0.5523 / 0.5617 / 0.5726 — **all worse** | 0.6297 / 0.6337 / 0.6338 / 0.6350 — one better |
| `bscan` global offset chosen by AUDIO alone | circularity (never sees our estimate) | 0.5440 @ **+0.6** | 0.5382 @ **+0.6** | 0.6300 @ **−0.6** (opposite sign) |
| `xw` offsets fitted on the *other* window | window-specific estimation noise | 0.5440 | 0.5398 | 0.6286 |
| `xwlag` the other window's lag | same | 0.5354 | 0.5471 | 0.6368 (worse) |
| `xwboth` other window's lag **and** offsets, fully held out | same | **0.5293** | **0.5335** | 0.6295 |

*Denominator note:* percentages quoted elsewhere for `xwboth` (80 % / 62 %)
are fractions of the gap between raw telemetry and our own audio-fitted
trajectory — w03 (0.5498 − 0.5241) and w04 (0.5506 − 0.5230). That
denominator involves our estimate, so for a claim that must stay free of
circularity, quote the residuals directly instead: the fully held-out
combination is the best of every corrected variant tested on both FLY124
windows.

Two facts carry the argument: a **one-parameter** time shift and a
**one-parameter** global offset, each selected by the audio with no reference
to our own trajectory, each **transferring to a window it was not fitted on**.
Random perturbations of the same magnitude go the *wrong* way on FLY124 and are
indistinguishable from the fitted ones on DREGON — which is the control that
makes "the telemetry is wrong" preferable to "any change helps".

*Scope caveat for citation:* `xwboth` is a genuine held-out transfer **between
the two FLY124 cruise windows**; it is not a held-out test across recordings,
and FLY124's constants were fitted on four cruise windows in total. State it
that way and no more strongly.

## WP14 — the value model challenged, and settled: ONE global scale, no per-rotor terms (2026-07-31)

WP13's rev/s calibration was fitted from 2–4 windows per recording, and its
`prot` points looked like they carried *per-rotor* structure (FLY124 rotor0
0.50/0.58 vs rotor2 0.91/0.84 — a 4–5× separation against their own scatter,
and *anti*-correlated with rotor speed, which contradicts a multiplicative
scale). The competing hypothesis was that the residual is not a calibration
error at all but a **per-rotor lag** between the ESC-reported speed and the
physical rotor — DREGON's `motors_command` vs `motors_measured` situation.

Both were tested. Sweep `scripts/michaels_calib/run_perrotor.py` (job
`python-ace021`, uni-cpu 16 cores, 22 min, 156 units), verdict tables
`scripts/michaels_calib/analyze_perrotor.py`. Baseline = **raw** rev/s
(`rps_scale=1.0`) with the shipped `time_offset`/`time_dilation`, all **13**
cruise windows (4 FLY124 + 9 FLY125), 4 rotors each. Rotors 1/3
(LFront/RBack) are the near-equal-speed twin pair the audio cannot resolve —
flagged everywhere, excluded from every fit.

### The ESC signal chain, from the CSV alone (no audio)

- Log rate 29.58 / 29.53 Hz (1 ms clock quantisation). `Motor:Speed` is
  **integer RPM** — 1 RPM = 0.0167 rev/s, 40× finer than the disputed 0.6 —
  and is *not* a reciprocal-period lattice.
- **Zero-order hold at ~17.0 Hz**: only 57.2–57.7 % of log frames change
  value, hold runs are essentially all exactly 1 frame. **All four rotors
  update on the SAME frames** (P(j changes | i changes) = 0.986–0.993 vs
  0.574 if independent) → the ESC telemetry block is sampled synchronously,
  there is **no round-robin stagger** and hence no per-rotor sampling-phase
  lag. The ZOH's ~29 ms mean staleness is *common* and already absorbed by
  `time_offset`.
- Command→response lag (`MotorCtrl:PWM` → `Motor:Speed`, z-scored, detrended;
  PWM is duty, so only the *timing* relation is meaningful): FLY124 50/63/58/76 ms,
  FLY125 60/70/83/85 ms (RFront/LFront/LBack/RBack) — **same rank order in both
  recordings**, so a ~25 ms per-rotor spread in the total command→report delay
  is real. It mixes the mechanical time constant, any reporting delay and the
  ZOH; the CSV cannot separate them.
- **The arithmetic that kills the lag hypothesis a priori**: cruise
  `d(rps)/dt` has RMS 15.3–19.2 rev/s² but **mean −0.08…+0.43 rev/s²**. A lag
  τ makes the error `−τ·ṙ`, so at τ = 30 ms it is 0.46–0.57 rev/s **RMS** but
  0.0003–0.013 rev/s in the **mean**. The disputed offsets are +0.5…+0.9 rev/s
  *constant and positive* — 40–600× more than any plausible lag can bias.
- Back-EMF cross-check (`Motor:Volts`·PWM/100 − I·R, per-rotor Kv): **cannot
  resolve a 0.8 % scale error.** Fitted Kv spans 4–8 % between rotors and is
  not even stable between recordings (LFront 345 → 310 RPM/V); residual RMS
  0.57–0.79 rev/s. Its one durable output: with a shared Kv/R the per-rotor
  residual means are reproducible across both recordings (LBack +0.68 always
  highest, RBack −0.79/−0.58 always lowest, ±0.7 rev/s) — i.e. per-rotor
  differences of a few tenths of a rev/s are physically ORDINARY for this rig
  and are not evidence of a telemetry fault. `Motor:V_out` is **not** an
  independent voltage (V_out ≈ 1.32 × PWM in every rotor).

### A — per-rotor offsets are NOT distinguishable (raw baseline, all windows)

| rec | rotor | n | mean rps | mean b | sd b | b/rps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FLY124 | RFront | 4 | 90.59 | 0.551 | 0.059 | 0.608 % |
| FLY124 | LBack | 4 | 80.42 | 0.650 | 0.252 | 0.808 % |
| FLY124 | *LFront (twin)* | 4 | 73.84 | *0.551* | *0.141* | — |
| FLY124 | *RBack (twin)* | 4 | 74.85 | *0.800* | *0.501* | — |
| FLY125 | RFront | 9 | 90.42 | 0.584 | 0.070 | 0.646 % |
| FLY125 | LBack | 9 | 81.16 | 0.635 | 0.148 | 0.782 % |
| FLY125 | *LFront (twin)* | 9 | 73.81 | *0.631* | *0.101* | — |
| FLY125 | *RBack (twin)* | 9 | 74.91 | *0.634* | *0.764* | — |

**Between-rotor spread is SMALLER than within-rotor scatter**: 0.099 vs 0.155
(FLY124), 0.051 vs 0.109 (FLY125) — ratios 0.64 and 0.47. The apparent
per-rotor structure in WP13 was a 2-window artefact. Adding per-rotor constants
buys **0 %** (FLY125) / 4 % (FLY124) of rms over one global constant. The
twin rotors are exactly where the wild scatter still lives (RBack sd 0.50 /
0.76), as expected.

Model rms on the non-twin points: FLY124 additive 0.166 / multiplicative 0.175
/ free line 0.164 / per-rotor const 0.159; FLY125 0.112 / 0.123 / 0.109 /
0.109. After refitting one global scale the residual rms (0.175 / 0.123) equals
the estimator's own per-window scatter — **there is no structure left to model**.

### B/C/D — the lag hypothesis is refuted, three independent ways

- **Acceleration split** (the `off` scan keeps per-frame residuals, so the
  apparent offset is re-minimised on any frame subset). Well-observed rotors,
  b(ṙ>0) − b(ṙ<0): +0.026 / +0.040 (FLY124 RFront/LBack), −0.014 / +0.075
  (FLY125) → implied τ = **−3.6…+0.8 ms**, inconsistent in sign and 20× below
  the measured 60–85 ms command→report delays. b at low |ṙ| vs high |ṙ| is
  flat (0.548 vs 0.557; 0.585 vs 0.576). **A calibration offset is flat in
  this split; it is.**
- **Per-rotor lag scan**: RFront −1.3 ± 1.8 ms (FLY124), +1.0 ± 4.0 ms
  (FLY125); LBack −14.9 ± 19.8 / +8.2 ± 16.1 ms — all consistent with zero.
- **Joint (τ_r, b_r) grid**: from the (0,0) origin, the offset axis alone buys
  Δrecon 0.0104 / 0.0092; the lag axis alone buys **0.0000** (4 dp); both
  together equal the offset alone. `argmin τ = 0` for every well-observed
  rotor. **The offset carries 100 % of the explanatory power.**

### The global magnitude, refitted on 13 windows

| rec | fitted g (non-twin) | scale (now shipped) | was shipped | residual after the OLD scale | after refit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FLY124 | 0.698 % ± 0.069 | 1.00698 | 1.00839 | mean **−0.117**, rms 0.213 | +0.004, rms 0.175 |
| FLY125 | 0.706 % ± 0.034 | 1.00706 | 1.00690 | mean +0.017, rms 0.124 | +0.003, rms 0.123 |

FLY125's shipped constant is **confirmed** (0.5 σ). FLY124's is **~0.14 pp too
high** — a +0.12 rev/s over-correction at cruise, the same sign and order as
the −0.18 rev/s residual the `--post-shipped` validation already flagged. The
two recordings' refitted gains agree to 0.008 pp, which the shipped pair did
not (0.15 pp apart).

### Additive vs multiplicative: still a tie, now leaning slightly additive

The only lever is RFront (90.5) vs LBack (80.8): multiplicative predicts the
faster rotor needs **more** correction (+0.07 rev/s), additive predicts equal.
Observed contrast is **negative** in both recordings: −0.099 ± 0.129 (−1.3 σ
from multiplicative, −0.8 σ from additive) and −0.051 ± 0.054 (−2.1 σ / −0.9 σ).
Stouffer-combined: −2.4 σ from multiplicative, −1.2 σ from additive. Weak, and
the direction (faster rotor needs *less*) is what *neither* model predicts.

Two arguments keep the multiplicative form anyway:
1. **Warm-up/idle safety** (the WP13 reason, unchanged): a scale vanishes at
   rps → 0, an additive +0.6 rev/s invents motion on a stationary rotor, and
   the published frames cover the ground/warm-up span.
2. **The global error is degenerate with a clock error, which is exactly
   multiplicative.** With εa = audio sample-rate error, εt = telemetry-clock
   error, εr = ESC rev/s scale error: `time_dilation − 1 ≈ εa − εt` and the
   audio-optimal gain `g ≈ −εa − εr`. Measured D−1 = +0.165 % / +0.518 %,
   g = +0.84 % / +0.69 %. Setting εr = 0 gives εa = −0.84 / −0.69 % (same
   device, agree to 0.15 pp) and εt = −1.00 / −1.21 % (agree to 0.21 pp);
   setting εa = 0 gives εr = −0.84 / −0.69 % and εt = −0.17 / −0.52 % (0.35 pp).
   Both self-consistent, not separable — but under **either** the correction is
   exactly multiplicative and vanishes at rps → 0. It also means the constant
   is a *label-for-this-audio* correction, not proof the telemetry is wrong.
   And no clock hypothesis can produce a per-rotor difference: εa is common to
   all four rotors.

### Verdict

**The shipped model FORM is right: one global multiplicative scale per
recording.** Per-rotor constant offsets are not identifiable (between-rotor
spread < within-rotor scatter) and a per-rotor lag is refuted outright. The
only defect is the **magnitude**: FLY124's 1.00839 was 0.14 pp too high
(+0.12 rev/s over-correction at cruise, ~1/5 of the error it removed, inside
the per-window scatter), and FLY125's 1.00690 was confirmed at 0.5 σ but is
worth replacing anyway so both constants come from the *same* fit.

### Applied (2026-07-31, commit on `michaels-label-calibration`)

`src/data_processing/michaels.py`:

| recording | was | now | source |
|---|---|---|---|
| FLY124 | 1.00839 | **1.00698** | 13-window global refit, non-twin rotors (g = 0.698 % ± 0.069) |
| FLY125 | 1.00690 | **1.00706** | same fit (g = 0.706 % ± 0.034) |

Rationale kept in the loader's block comment: the two refits agree to 0.008 pp
(one shared cause), the superseded pair was a 2–4 window per-rotor mean
contaminated by the twin rotors and disagreed by 0.15 pp, and the whole global
gain is degenerate with a sample-clock error — so it is a *label-for-this-audio*
correction, and, since a clock error is common to all four rotors, that same
degeneracy independently supports the global-only verdict.

`michaels-frames` republished at **`fdef818432e9`** (was `a7a951b94808`) and
re-pinned in `dload.lock`. Verified on the published frames: `rps` is
**bitwise-exactly** `(raw Motor:Speed RPM / 60) × scale` on both recordings,
`meta.rps_scale` carries the new value, and CSV completeness is unchanged
(230 columns → 212 numeric channels across 18 per-sensor-block Series + 14
bool/string Series; only `ConvertDatV3` and `4.2.1` absent, both all-empty).

### Re-validated on the corrected labels (job `python-b7e225`, 636 s, uni-cpu)

`run_sweep.py --post-shipped`, 13 cruise windows, no edge hits:

| recording | n | resid lag mean / RMS / max | resid value offset mean | resid value max | (old scales, `python-0445f6`) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FLY124 | 4 | −2.92 / 3.40 / 4.29 ms | **−0.054** rev/s | 0.120 | −0.178 rev/s |
| FLY125 | 9 | +1.21 / 3.22 / 8.04 ms | **−0.009** rev/s | 0.096 | +0.004 rev/s |

Timing is untouched and still closed (residual lag RMS at the 2.9 / 4.5 ms level
of the dilation fit's own residual; FLY124's per-window residuals
+0.03/−3.29/−4.11/−4.29 ms carry no monotone drift). **FLY124's value error fell
3.3×**, −0.178 → −0.054 rev/s, i.e. ~1/10 of the 0.56 rev/s the calibration
removes; FLY125 is unchanged within noise (+0.004 → −0.009).

The −0.054 rev/s leftover is slightly more than the +0.004 the refit projected,
and the reason is that the two estimators are not the same measurement: the
refit regresses per-rotor `prot` offsets on the **non-twin** rotors, whereas this
scan finds one global offset over **all four**, including the twin pair whose
individual estimates the audio cannot resolve (RBack's sd alone is 0.50 / 0.76
rev/s). Both numbers sit well inside the 0.175–0.213 rev/s per-window scatter,
so there is no residual structure left to chase — consistent with WP14's finding
that the refit residual already equals the estimator's own noise.

The WP13 "stale artefacts" table still applies verbatim — every entry in it now
also predates this second label change, and the two `michaels-frames` versions
differ by −0.14 pp on FLY124 / +0.016 pp on FLY125 (−0.11 / +0.013 rev/s at
cruise), i.e. small next to the 0.55–0.67 rev/s WP13 already moved.

## WP15 — the w03 seed flip was a coin flip; the steady-window loss is all M2 (2026-07-31)

The two open items the beat-VK re-score left (`docs/experiments/beat-vk.md`
§ "Protocol recalibrated and re-scored"). Driver `scripts/refine_gate_probe.py`;
jobs **`python-74f6e0`** (diagnostics: the full arm-R residual scan per window
per build + every M2 proposal dumped next to the truth) and **`python-5d65f0`**
(the re-score with both fixes). Both diagnostics are *dumps*, so every
candidate rule below was scored offline, exactly, without re-running the chain.

### (a) FLY124 w03 — arm R was adjudicating a 0.06 % tie

The residual re-scan's admissible set (robust z ≥ 3.0, ≥ `dedup_rps` from every
used base, ≤ 1.15 × the highest used base) on w03 is **three** candidates, and
arm R takes the highest-z one:

| build | 54.45 | 82.65/82.70 | 80.90 | taken |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| pre-recalibration (`@268c7660`) | z 3.198, score 0.05303 | z **3.199**, score **0.05306** | z 3.024 | 82.70 ✓ |
| post-recalibration (`@54849c13`) | z **3.235**, score **0.05228** | z 3.207, score 0.05150 | z 3.062 | 54.45 ✗ |

The two leaders are separated by **0.06 % of score** in the old build. The
86.188 ms realignment moved both by ~1.5 % and reversed the order. So the
"good" pre-recalibration seed was never a property of the seeder — it won a
coin flip, and the recalibration lost it. Nothing about thresholds, scan
windows or energy normalisation is on a knife edge; the *ranking* is.

**Fix — the rotor-band prior arm R was missing on the low side.**
`SeedConfig.r_span_max = 1.45`: reject a residual candidate that would stretch
the seed set's max/min beyond that ratio. 54.45 against a used 92.35 spans
**1.696**; 82.65 spans 1.245. The prior is the same physical one already
encoded in `r_span_pad` (1.15), `promote_span` (1.30) and
`_harmonic_alias_filter` ("rotors of one drone in cruise lie within ~1.25×"),
and 1.45 is loose: the widest set any real protocol window seeds is 1.31
(FLY124 warm-up w00/w01).

Verified at the seed stage on **all 15 real windows × both protocol builds**:
the nine DREGON windows admit **no** residual candidate at all (their seeds are
two `split_nudge` twin pairs — arm R's `residual_new` is empty), FLY124
w00/w01/w04 have exactly one admissible candidate each at span 1.22–1.31, and
w02/w05 none. The bound therefore changes w03 and nothing else.

*Honest caveat:* the fix removes the *implausible* candidate, it does not make
the remaining choice robust. 82.65 still beats 80.90 by only 4.7 % of z, and
the true 4th rotor is at ~80.7 — i.e. arm R picks a base ~1.9 rev/s high, which
is exactly why w03's 4th-rotor MAE lands near 1.0 rather than near 0.3. The
low-contrast residual ranking is the structural weakness; `r_span_max` only
stops it from being catastrophically wrong.

### (b) The steady-window regression is M2 — M1 is a no-op

Per-stage, from the re-score's own JSONs (`capture → m1_r1 → m2_solo`,
`--v2-rounds 1`), on the nine DREGON windows:

| window | capture | M1 | M2-solo | ΔM1 | ΔM2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| nosource w00 (ramp) | 3.272 | 3.272 | 3.197 | 0.000 | **−0.075** |
| nosource w01 | 1.021 | 1.032 | 1.472 | +0.011 | **+0.440** |
| nosource w02 | 0.999 | 0.999 | 1.320 | 0.000 | **+0.321** |
| speech-low w00 (ramp) | 2.850 | 2.850 | 2.952 | 0.000 | +0.102 |
| speech-low w01 | 1.045 | 1.045 | 1.333 | 0.000 | **+0.288** |
| speech-low w02 | 0.995 | 0.995 | 1.404 | 0.000 | **+0.409** |
| whitenoise w00 (ramp) | 4.046 | 4.046 | 4.032 | 0.000 | −0.014 |
| whitenoise w01 | 0.979 | 0.979 | 1.531 | 0.000 | **+0.552** |
| whitenoise w02 | 1.153 | 1.153 | 1.561 | 0.000 | **+0.408** |

**M1 moves nothing on 8 of 9 DREGON windows** — its surface-quality gate
skips ALL FOUR rotors on 8 of them (`quals` 0.077–0.150 against the 0.15
absolute floor; only `nosource w01` has a rotor above it, and moving that one
costs +0.011),
so hypothesis (i) — "M1's corridor moves a rotor that was already correct" — is
refuted. Every rev/s of the regression is M2, and the per-rotor decomposition
names the mechanism: on each steady window **one or two rotors acquire a
1.2–2.4 rev/s NEGATIVE bias** while the others barely move (nosource w01 rotor
bias −0.31/−0.68 → −1.52/−2.16; whitenoise w01 +0.29/−0.59 → −1.20/−2.36).
That is a capture event, not a bias correction — hypothesis (ii).

Why: DREGON cruise is two tight twin pairs, so the siblings' VK reconstruction
explains only about a third of the RMS (`m2_ratios` **0.645–0.722** on every
steady window), and `PK_WIDE`'s first band is 12 Hz at k ≤ 4 = ±12 rev/s of
capture at k = 1. A single-track solve on a residual that still contains the
twin's comb slides onto it. Hypothesis (iii) (the surface-quality gate) is not
in play at all — that gate belongs to M1.

The ramp windows are a *different* failure: there `m2_ratios` are 2.7–134, the
`M2_RESID_GUARD` trips, and the ungated code falls back to running the wide
pi_kalman on the **plain audio** — i.e. not a decoupling step at all. That is
where FLY124 w01 goes 2.128 → 4.824 and w00 5.082 → 5.701.

### (c) The gate: M2 declines when its own premise fails

Scored offline over all 60 real-window proposals
(`results/refine_gate_probe/m2`), rebuilding the M2 output under each rule:

| rule | dregon_cruise (9) | fly124_cruise (4) | all 15 | vs baseline (W/T/L) | max loss |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline chain | 1.825 | 3.992 | 2.646 | — | — |
| M1 output (drop M2) | 1.819 | 3.940 | 2.623 | 8/2/5 | +0.014 |
| **M2 ungated (as shipped)** | **2.089** | **4.011** | **3.025** | **3/0/12** | **+2.702** |
| recon-ok only | 2.088 | 4.011 | 2.843 | 4/0/11 | +0.613 |
| **recon-ok + move ≤ 0.5 + occupied** | **1.822** | **3.912** | **2.617** | **8/1/6** | **+0.019** |
| recon-ok + move ≤ 0.75 + occupied | 1.835 | 3.920 | 2.627 | 7/0/8 | +0.040 |
| recon-ok + move ≤ 1.0 + occupied | 1.844 | 3.895 | 2.626 | 6/0/9 | +0.082 |

Shipped as `--m2-gate move` (`M2_GATE`, default still `off` so every recorded
WP6–WP12 number stays reproducible). Three truth-free per-rotor rules:

0. **no residual, no M2** — if the sibling reconstruction diverged, decline
   instead of falling back to the plain audio (the ramp failure above);
1. **move** — reject `mean |Δ| > M2_MOVE_MAX = 0.5` rev/s. M2 exists to remove
   sibling-interference bias, which WP3 measured at 0.3–0.5 rev/s; an order of
   magnitude more is a re-capture. The offline optimum is a **plateau** from
   0.25 to 0.75 (2.617–2.627 pooled), so 0.5 is both the middle of the measured
   plateau and the physical scale;
2. **occupied comb** — reject a proposal landing within 1.5 rev/s of a sibling
   it was not already that close to (`stage_guard`'s rule 1 at M2 scale — the
   ladder's own guard has a 3.0 rev/s move floor and cannot see M2-scale
   re-captures). *Inert on all 15 windows*, kept because it is the mechanism.

Comb confidence before/after is recorded but **not** used as a veto: it is a
*better* rule than the move test on these windows (all-15 2.608), and that is
precisely the WP8 trap — the destination of a bad M2 move is a stronger comb,
so confidence rises when it should not. The 0.009 rev/s it buys is not worth
depending on a statistic that is known to point the wrong way.

**What the gate is, honestly:** on real windows it turns M2 into a near-no-op
(it rejects **54 of the 60** per-rotor proposals), so gated `refine_v2` ≈ its own M1 output ≈ the
baseline chain. That is the intended outcome — "never worse than baseline" —
not a new source of gain.

### (d) The span bound alone was not enough — arm R then took the rotor TWICE

The first re-score (`python-5d65f0`) came back with w03 at **1.821**, not the
~0.99 the seed-swap control had promised, and the seed explained why:
`[74.2, 80.9, 82.65, 92.35]`. Removing 54.45 had un-shadowed **80.90**, which
`_harmonic_alias_filter` had been dropping as 54.45's 3:2 alias (80.9/54.45 =
1.486). arm R then accepted *both* 82.65 and 80.90 — 1.75 rev/s apart, both
sitting on the same ~80.7 rotor — which spent two rotor slots on one physical
rotor and left the 74/75 twin pair with a single track (final means
`[74.28, 81.02, 81.83, 91.50]`, one rotor at MAE 5.11).

Second guard: **mutual dedup of the accepted residual candidates**, contrast
first, at the same `dedup_rps = 2.5` the *used* bases already enforce. The
existing rule ("closer residual peaks are wander tails / twin residue, not
distinct combs") was simply never applied between two NEW combs. With it, w03
accepts `[82.65]` alone. Replayed over all 30 window-builds: **29 bit-identical
to the shipped seeder, and the old build's w03 back to its historical
`[82.70]`** — the tightest available proof that the change is the intended
one-window repair.

### (e) Re-scored, both fixes in (`python-cf3bbc`)

Per-window final PIT-MAE vs RAW telemetry, `--v2-rounds 1`. *pre* = the
`python-764ca5` re-score (flipped seed, ungated M2). `refine_v3 ≡ refine_v2` on
all 15 windows, as before.

¹ the only cell that does not reproduce bit-exactly (4.063 → 4.059, 0.1 %):
run-to-run BLAS-reduction jitter, identical seed and identical inputs.

| pool | pre baseline | pre v2/v3 | **baseline** | **v2/v3** | **v2/v3 gated** | v3 + cross-window | v3 gated + cross-window |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| dregon_cruise (9) | 1.825 | 2.089 | **1.825** | 2.089 | **1.819** | — | — |
| fly124_cruise (4) | 3.992 | 4.011 | **2.418** | 2.510 | **2.380** | 1.995 | **1.864** |

| all 15 | 2.646 | 3.025 | **2.226** | 2.624 | **2.207** | — | — |

The seed fix alone is worth **1.574 rev/s** on the FLY124 cruise pool
(3.992 → 2.418), and the recovered blind baseline reproduces the seed-swap
control (2.421) to 0.003. **w05's WP12 cross-window repair fires again**
(3.030 → 0.972 ungated, 0.901 gated) now that w03 supplies the second vote for
the ~82 base.

**Cost on synthetic, measured in the same job:** the gate costs ~6 % on the
13-window battery (refine_v2 2.196 → 2.318, refine_v3 1.767 → 1.872) — M2 does
pay there, where the sibling reconstruction is clean. Hence `M2_GATE` ships
`off` and `--m2-gate move` is a real-data switch, exactly like `--v2-rounds 1`.
*Limitation:* the seeder change was verified seed-by-seed only on the 15 real
windows; its effect on the synthetic battery's seeds was not isolated, so the
synthetic column is a within-job gate comparison, not a cross-version one.

## WP16 — the joint-tracker mode prior: NOT SUPPORTED by the telemetry (2026-07-31)

A joint 4-rotor beam-search tracker was designed to replace the coarse stage's
single shared trajectory `c(t)` (WP3's "all four rotors share one shape by
construction"). Its load-bearing idea was a transition prior in
control-allocation mode space — with `B = rps_synthesis.MIXER`, `BᵀB = 4I`:

```
Δm = Bᵀ Δw / 4            T(w_t | w_{t−1}) = Σ_i ψ_i(Δm_i / σ_i)
```

cheap along the common mode, expensive along roll/pitch/yaw, so that a move
*correlated* across rotors costs little while the same move on one rotor alone
is heavily penalised. The design set its own precondition: `σ_common / σ_diff`
measured from real telemetry should be **3–10**, and if it came out ≈ 1 the
premise was wrong.

**It comes out at 1.0 (DREGON) to 1.9 (Michael's).** Measurement:
`scripts/mode_covariance_calib.py` (`--json results/mode_covariance_calib.json`),
run locally in ~40 s over every recording with rotor telemetry. Per-frame
(32 ms, the scorer's grid) increments, robust scale MAD × 1.4826, cruise =
every rotor ≥ 50 rev/s:

| recording (telemetry) | n | σ_common | σ_roll | σ_pitch | σ_yaw | σ_diff | **ratio** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DREGON nosource_room1 `measured` | 1851 | 0.5200 | 0.5256 | 0.5282 | 0.4903 | 0.5150 | **1.01** |

Ramp regime (takeoff/landing, mean > 5 rev/s and not yet cruise), same
convention — note MAD removes the sustained ramp *drift*, so these are the
fluctuation about it, not the ramp itself:

| recording | n | σ_common | σ_diff | ratio |

### Why this kills the mechanism, quantitatively

Rotor identity is arbitrary under PIT, and only the differential *subspace*
(the orthogonal complement of the all-ones vector) is permutation-invariant —
so a usable prior must share **one** σ_d across roll/pitch/yaw (verified: the
ratio is identical to 3 dp over all 24 rotor permutations, and the three
measured σ's differ by ≤ 8 % on DREGON anyway). With a quadratic ψ:

```
move δ on ALL FOUR rotors : (δ/σ_c)²
move δ on ONE rotor       : (δ²/16)(1/σ_c² + 3/σ_d²)
cost(one)/cost(four)      = 1/16 + (3/16)(σ_c/σ_d)²
```

The prior only prefers the correlated move above **σ_c/σ_d = √5 = 2.236**.
Measured, the ratio is 0.97–1.07 (DREGON) and 1.64–1.93 (Michael's), giving
cost(one)/cost(four) of **0.24–0.29** and **0.57–0.75**. *The prior as
specified makes an uncorrelated single-rotor move CHEAPER than the correlated
move it was designed to prefer, on every recording we have.* This is not a
tuning failure — it is what the increment statistics are.

### It is not an artefact — four checks

- **Rotor ordering** is irrelevant: σ_common is permutation-invariant by
  construction and the measured ratio is constant to 3 dp over all 24
  permutations.
- **Lag**: the ratio rises only weakly with lag — DREGON 1.01 → 1.43 from
  32 ms to 1.024 s; Michael's peaks at 2.19 (FLY124, 0.128 s) and falls back
  to 1.73 at 1 s. It never reaches 3.
- **Shaft band-limit** (a real rotor cannot follow a white drive, WP4 item 5):
  zero-phase lowpass at fc = 12/8/5/2 Hz gives DREGON 0.99/1.03/1.11/1.52 and
  Michael's FLY124 1.93/2.01/2.19/1.91. Same answer.
- **Telemetry quantisation** *is* real and does inflate DREGON's isotropy —
  `motors_measured` is a **reciprocal-period lattice** (a period counter:
  `1/v` uniformly spaced at 42 µs), giving a **0.28 rev/s** step at 80 rev/s
  and updating at only **44–45 Hz** with ZOH in between. A 32 ms increment is
  therefore 1–2 lattice steps ≈ the measured 0.5 MAD, isotropic across rotors
  by construction. (This is the same defect as the documented "DREGON GT
  carries ±0.6 rev/s fast jitter".) But Michael's is 1 RPM = 0.0168 rev/s,
  quantisation-free at this scale, and it still says **1.6–1.9**. Correcting
  DREGON via the −0.5 lag-1 autocorrelation signature of white noise gives a
  "dynamic" ratio of 1.35–1.90. Every route lands in 1.0–2.2.

DREGON `motors_command` (a second, independent telemetry channel — run the
script without `--measured-only`) agrees: cruise ratios 0.96–1.05 on the five
room1 recordings. The one outlier in the whole set is
`free-flight_nosource_room2[command]` at 2.26 — the only recording with *no*
`motors_measured`, and its ratio decays to 0.97 by a 1 s lag, so it is not a
counterexample either. Command-track *ramp* rows are meaningless (the
documented leading/trailing logging freeze makes the differential modes
exactly zero) and are excluded.

### What IS true, and where the anisotropy actually lives

The design's *intuition* is right; it was attached to the wrong statistic.

- **Trajectory-amplitude** anisotropy over a cruise segment is real:
  σ_common / σ_diff = **2.61–3.80** (DREGON `measured`, 5 recordings) and
  **1.85–2.79** (Michael's). This corroborates `rps_synthesis.DEFAULT_CONFIG`
  (common std 4.0 vs diff rms ≈ 1.03, ratio 3.9), which was itself calibrated
  from DREGON.
- **Ramp excursions are overwhelmingly common-mode**: over the takeoff the
  common mode swings 54–57 rev/s (DREGON) / 42–50 (Michael's) while each
  differential mode swings 0.9–8.4 — an excursion ratio of **7.7–14.2**.
- **ψ_common must indeed be heavy-tailed**: during a takeoff |Δm_common| has
  p50 0.04, p90 1.3, p99 3.8 and max 7.7 rev/s per 32 ms frame on DREGON — a
  **15 σ** event against the cruise σ_common; on Michael's FLY124 the max is
  19.2 rev/s = **219 σ**. A Gaussian common mode would flatten every ramp.

The gap between these two facts is the whole finding: **the anisotropy is in
the mode LEVEL (an OU restoring force on the differential modes), not in the
mode INCREMENT.** A first-order Markov prior on increments cannot express it —
by construction it only sees Δ. To get the leverage the design wanted you would
need a prior on the differential mode *magnitude* relative to its own running
mean, and even then the honest leverage is the amplitude ratio (2.6–3.8 on
DREGON, 1.9–2.8 on Michael's), i.e. the very bottom of the design's expected
3–10 band, not the middle.

### Consequence

The tracker was **not built**. The design's own stop rule fired, and the
break-even algebra above says the prior would have pushed in the wrong
direction. Two things survive the measurement and are worth stating separately,
because they are independent of the mode prior:

1. **The joint search itself.** Breaking the shared-shape constraint — four
   independent per-rotor trajectories, top-k peak candidates, local-move
   candidates for coasting, an overlap repulsion, beam search — needs no mode
   anisotropy at all. An *isotropic* per-rotor smoothness prior would do, and
   its σ is now calibrated: the **per-rotor** increment scale at 32 ms is
   0.31–0.37 rev/s at a physical band-limit (fc 5 Hz; 0.38–0.57 at fc 8;
   Michael's raw 0.31–0.33, DREGON raw 1.00–1.04 but quantisation-dominated).
   A 2 rev/s single-frame jump is then a 3.5–6.5 σ event under a plain
   isotropic prior — meaningful suppression, and the mode decomposition buys
   only 1.0–2.2× on top of it. The mode structure is not what would make the
   joint search work or fail.
2. **The diagnosis that motivated it stands** — WP3's shared-shape defect and
   WP15's finding that M1 is gated off on 8 of 9 DREGON windows are unchanged.
   What is now measured is that *this particular* prior is not the lever.

## WP17 — the OU-corrected joint tracker: prior fixed, but 100x too weak (2026-07-31)

WP16 killed the *increment* form of the joint tracker's mode prior. The
correction is right and was implemented: the proposal was a 4-D **OU** process
and WP16's design spec had kept only its diffusion half, dropping the
mean-reversion term — which is exactly where the measured anisotropy lives.
Full discrete-time OU, per mode, with `a = exp(-dt/tau)` and
`s = sigma_level*sqrt(1-a^2)`:

```
residual_i = m_i(t) - a_i m_i(t-1) - (1-a_i) mu_i        cost = sum_i psi_i(residual_i / s_i)
```

Implemented in `src/data_processing/joint_beam_tracker.py` (torch,
device-agnostic), wired as lab chain `joint_beam`, 39 unit tests in
`tests/test_joint_beam_tracker.py`, swept by `scripts/jb_sweep.py`.

### The fit: tau per mode alongside sigma

`scripts/mode_covariance_calib.py`, cruise segments, fitted from the
autocovariance decay over lags 2-64 so the reciprocal-period label noise (which
contributes only at lag 0) does not bias tau. `s` is the implied per-frame
innovation scale at dt = 32 ms.

Shipped defaults (DREGON medians, one scale shared by roll/pitch/yaw — forced,
see below): **tau_diff 1.81 s, sigma_level_diff 0.77 rev/s**, common mode a
random walk at 0.39 rev/s per frame.

Three things the fit itself says:

- **tau_common is NOT >> tau_diff.** The design's expectation was
  `tau_c/tau_d ~ 14`; measured, the differential taus are as long as or longer
  than the common one on 5 of 7 recordings (`R_ou = tau_c V_c / tau_d V_d`
  ranges 1.02-18.29, median 4.47). Under the *symmetric* OU the coordinator
  specified, the sustained-offset cost ratio `1/16 + (3/16) R_ou` comes out at
  **0.25-3.49, median 0.90** — still around break-even.
- **The label-noise column is why the increment estimator failed** — DREGON's
  fitted noise (0.34-2.15) is comparable to or larger than the signal it sits
  on, and it is isotropic across modes by construction.
- The implied `s` for the differential modes (0.08-0.38) agrees with the
  independently measured band-limited (fc 5 Hz) increment scale (0.09-0.11), so
  the fit is self-consistent.

### The verdict: the ratio bar is cleared, the MAGNITUDE bar is not

Making the common mode a **random walk** (which WP16's ramp measurements force
— a finite `tau_common` charges ~170 cost units to hold a 56 rev/s takeoff over
a 16 s window and flattens it) does deliver the qualitative discrimination the
design wanted: a sustained *common* offset is free, a sustained *single-rotor*
offset is charged forever, so the ratio is **infinite**. Unit-tested.

But the magnitude is what decides beam search, and it is negligible. Summing
the per-frame OU cost of *holding* a single-rotor offset `delta` over a window
of duration `T` gives `3 T delta^2 / (64 tau_d sigma_d^2)`:

| offset held for a 16 s window | at the fitted sigma (0.77) | at the tracker's working slack (x3) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 rev/s | 0.70 | 0.08 |
| 2 rev/s | 2.80 | 0.31 |
| 4 rev/s | 11.2 | 1.24 |

Against an emission budget of `lambda_e (3) x 4 rotors x 500 frames = 6000` for
the window, in which one rotor moving a single grid step typically changes the
emission by O(150-750). **The mean-reversion term is 2-3 orders of magnitude
too weak to arbitrate a comb assignment.** This is not tuning: the cost scales
as `T delta^2 / (tau sigma^2)`, so making it competitive needs
`sigma_d ~ 0.05` rev/s (15x below the measurement) or `tau_d ~ 8 ms` (200x
shorter). The telemetry says otherwise, on every recording.

So the corrected prior is the right *form* — WP16's diagnosis was accurate and
the mean-reversion term is where the anisotropy lives — but the anisotropy that
is actually there is far too small to be the mechanism that stops a rotor
sliding onto a neighbour's comb.

### What the implementation had to settle, and what it measured on the way

Four decisions the design did not cover, each forced by a measurement:

1. **One tau and one sigma shared by roll/pitch/yaw.** Rotor identity is
   arbitrary under PIT and a relabelling maps the differential subspace to
   itself by an orthogonal `M = Bd^T P Bd / 4`, so per-mode scales make the
   answer depend on a meaningless labelling. Unit-tested over all 24
   permutations, with a companion test showing per-mode scales break it. Costs
   nothing: the fitted per-mode taus have no consistent ordering across
   recordings.
2. **Overlap is a double-count correction, not a repulsion.** Design §2 v1 (a
   distance-only soft repulsion) measurably cannot do both jobs: a radius wide
   enough to stop three tracks stacking on one hump also charges the genuine
   twins real quadrotors run 0.5-2 rev/s apart, and at `r1 = 1.0` with
   `gain = 2` the tracker preferred to park a track on EMPTY grid (101 rev/s)
   rather than sit beside its twin at 75. Replaced by
   `sum_{r<s} max(min(S_r,S_s),0) exp(-d^2/2 sigma^2)`, which removes exactly
   the duplicated evidence at zero separation and vanishes where the scores are
   weak. This is the cheap diagonal of design §2's v2 union-comb score.
3. **The k-scaled analysis bandwidth (`B_k = k B0`) is a LOSS here, and the
   reason is structural.** It is a capture device — it helps an estimator that
   must find a tooth near where it currently thinks the rotor is. This stage is
   a dense search over an explicit 12-120 rev/s grid, so it never has to
   capture anything, and widening the band only blurs the surface it searches.
   The *emission's own ceiling* (per-frame argmax within +-3 rev/s of truth,
   correlated against the true per-rotor shape) falls monotonically:
   b0 = 0 -> 0.92/0.83/0.97/0.98, 0.25 -> 0.83/0.74/0.97/0.98, 0.5 ->
   0.77/0.71/0.95/0.95, 1.0 -> 0.65/0.83/0.93/0.90. Implemented and kept as the
   A/B lever (`EmissionCfg.b0_rps`, exact reproduction of
   `_single_comb_scores` at 0), defaulted OFF. Its separate claim — that with a
   k-scaled band the capture radius stops shrinking as `bin/k` — is unit-tested
   and true; it is just not what this stage needs. A by-product worth keeping:
   a fixed 5 samples across the pooled band UNDER-samples it at high k (at
   k = 16, b0 = 1.5 the spacing is 1.5 bins, wider than the spectral line, and
   the pooled max misses the tooth it was widened to catch, 0.93 -> 0.30), so
   the sample count is now derived from `k_max * b0 / bin_hz`.
4. **`n_local = 3`, not the design's 5.** The local family dominates cost
   (123 -> 60 s per 16 s window) and 3 is no worse on the synthetic battery —
   identical shape correlations and mean error, and it actually RESOLVES the
   twin case that 5 and 7 lose, because a wider per-frame reach lets a track
   wander onto a neighbour's hump.

Also, on the emission/prior balance: at the fitted (truth) innovation scales the
prior is too stiff for a rotor to follow its own comb across the 0.5 rev/s grid.
Worst per-rotor shape correlation on the synthetic wiggle battery, by `s_scale`
at `lambda_e = 3`: 1.0 -> 0.30, **2.0 -> 0.94**, 3.0 -> 0.94, 6.0 -> 0.94; at
`s_scale = 2, lambda_e = 1` it is 0.40. Shipped `s_scale = 3`.

### Measured: init quality on the 15-window real protocol — a 5-10x REGRESSION

`scripts/jb_sweep.py --mode init` scores the trajectory immediately after the
init stage, with no VK capture / M1 / M2 (design §6 item 1). Cheap by
construction — and for `joint_beam`, seedless: its candidates come from the
score surface, so it needs no `blind_seed` at all.

**Versus the current coarse init** (`fullrange_init`, same stage, same metric —
run on the two canonical lab reference windows; the control needs `blind_seed`,
which the joint search does not, and that asymmetry cost 226-301 s per window
here):

| window | | coarse init | joint_beam |
|---|---|---|---|
| nosource w00 (ramp) | PIT-MAE | **3.45** | 39.64 |
| | std_ratio | 1.03 | 0.35 |
| | per-rotor shape_corr | **0.95 / 0.95 / 0.95 / 0.95** | 0.92 / 0.80 / 0.95 / 0.85 |
| nosource w01 (steady) | PIT-MAE | **1.15** | 22.57 |
| | std_ratio | 0.00 | 1.08 |
| | per-rotor shape_corr | **-0.00 / 0.01 / 0.00 / -0.01** | 0.43 / 0.41 / 0.07 / 0.28 |

The control's own columns are WP3's diagnosis reproduced exactly, and they are
worth keeping on the record: on the ramp the four coarse shape correlations are
**identical to two decimals** (the single-scalar DP state made visible), and on
the steady window the trust gate fires (`coarse_mode = const-steady`) so the
init is four *constant* lines with `std_ratio` 0.00 and no shape at all. The
joint tracker breaks both — its four correlations genuinely differ — and is
still 11x and 20x worse in absolute error. That is the whole result in one
table: **the shared-shape constraint was never the binding one.**

| pool | init PIT-MAE | std_ratio | shape_corr | corr spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| dregon (9) | **26.03** | 0.88 | 0.16 | 0.54 |
| fly124_cruise (4) | **22.40** | 0.86 | 0.42 | 0.82 |
| ramp (5) | 27.13 | 0.35 | 0.22 | 0.52 |
| steady (10) | 21.56 | 1.08 | 0.19 | 0.65 |

Against a `fullrange_init` coarse init of ~3-5 and a *whole-chain* baseline of
DREGON cruise 1.825 / FLY124 cruise 2.418, this is a **5-10x regression**. No
downstream stage recovers it — WP7 established that nothing below the init
invents a comb — so the end-of-chain run was not spent.

The `std_ratio` / `shape_corr` columns are the part worth reading carefully.
The shared-shape defect IS gone in the literal sense the design asked for: the
four shape correlations now differ by 0.14-1.09 where the coarse stage makes
them near-identical by construction, and `std_ratio` is 0.84-2.21 on steady
windows rather than one shared value. But they differ because they are
**wrong**, not because they are individuated: `shape_corr` is ~0 or negative on
6 of 10 steady windows. Shape diversity is necessary, not sufficient, and this
is the case that separates the two.

### Why it fails: the emission double-counts across OCTAVES, not just neighbours

The failure is legible in the means column. **52 % of tracks sit at a small
integer ratio (x1.5, x2, x3, x4) of a sibling, and 45 % land below 55 rev/s**,
where this airframe has no rotor at all. Repeatedly the four tracks come out as
`21 / 42 / 85 / …` — the subharmonic family of one true ~85 rev/s comb.

The mechanism is design §2's own caveat, one octave out. `E = sum_r S(c_r, t)`
double-counts shared evidence, and a comb at `c/2` shares *every other tooth*
with a comb at `c` — so two tracks an octave apart score nearly twice for one
comb while sitting 40 rev/s apart, where any distance-based overlap kernel
(v1, and my score-scaled repair of it) sees nothing at all. Both forms only
police *co-located* rotors. The union-comb score (design §2 v2) is the one that
handles shared teeth exactly, and this measurement says it is not an optional
follow-up for a seedless wide-grid joint search — it is a precondition.

The existing chain never had this problem because it never had this freedom:
`blind_seed` supplies bases pre-filtered for aliases (`_harmonic_alias_filter`,
the 3:2 guard, `r_span_pad`/`r_span_max`), and `fullrange_init` adds the BPF
octave check (`COARSE_HALVE_RATIO`) and a rotor-band-restricted grid. Dropping
the seed — advertised as a benefit, since it removes the WP15 seeding lottery —
also dropped every alias defence the pipeline has, and the joint search walked
straight into the hole they were dug for.

### Status and what would have to change

`joint_beam` is committed, tested and wired, and it is **not** a candidate for
the production chain at these numbers. Three things would have to land before
it is worth re-measuring, in order of how much they are load-bearing:

1. **Union-comb emission** (design §2 v2) — score the union of the assignment's
   teeth so an octave pair cannot bank the same evidence twice. Expensive per
   proposal, which is exactly why the design deferred it; the measurement says
   it cannot be deferred.
2. **A rotor-band prior on the assignment** — the seeder's own physical prior
   (four rotors of one drone lie within ~1.25-1.45x) applied to the beam state
   rather than to seed bases. Cheap, and it kills the `21/42/85` family outright.
3. Only then is it meaningful to ask whether the OU prior helps — and per the
   magnitude table above, the answer is that it cannot, at the measured
   `tau ~ 1.8 s` and `sigma ~ 0.77` rev/s, contribute more than ~1 cost unit
   against an emission budget of ~6000.

## WP18 — the across-harmonic covariance of the rate opinions, MEASURED (2026-07-31)

The Fisher-weighted phase-slope stage weights harmonic `k` by `k²|p_k|`
(`vk_tracking._freq_update`: `w = kf**2 * np.abs(prod)`), a weight derived by
assuming each harmonic's phase error is independent additive noise. The
INSERT-D analysis argued that arrival-time jitter breaks that: harmonic `k`'s
phase error is `2πk·r·n_t`, and dividing by `k` to get a *rate* opinion cancels
the `k`, so writing `δ̂_k = δ + J + e_k` the covariance across harmonics is
rank-one plus diagonal, `Σ = σ_J²·11ᵀ + diag(v_k)`, with a fused variance
`1/W + σ_J²` — an irreducible floor, and a saturation harmonic `k*`.

Measured, not assumed. Estimator `tracking/phase_noise.py` (+
`tests/tracking/test_phase_noise.py`), results `results/phase_noise_covariance/`
(job `python-47e101`, 12 min, uni-cpu) and
`results/phase_noise_covariance_framegrid/` (`python-f86558`).

**Method.** Per (window, rotor, channel): demodulate `k = 1..30` along the
window's best trajectory, brickwall to the arm's band `B_k`, form
`δ̂_k[t] = arg(z_k[t+1] z̄_k[t])·f_env/(2πk)` at the stage's own `f_env = 62.5`
Hz, and take the K×K covariance with **pairwise-complete** observations under
the existing per-frame twin gate. Moment fit: `σ_J² = mean(off-diagonals)`,
`v_k = C_kk − σ_J²` (robust: median). Three things the naive recipe gets wrong:

- **`v_k` needs no time high-pass.** `δ` is common across harmonics, so it
  lands in the rank-one term and cancels out of `v_k = C_kk − common_k` at any
  cutoff. `v_k` is therefore read at `f_c = 0` — the FULL in-band variance,
  which is what a weight needs. Only `σ_J²` needs the cutoff, and it is
  reported as a *curve* rather than one number: the cutoff **is** the
  operational boundary between "slow enough for the stage to track" and
  "irreducible".
- **k-scaled arms filter the common term per harmonic**, so `C_ij` measures the
  common power up to `min(B_i, B_j)`; the common estimate is read off partners
  whose band is at least as wide. Falls back to the plain off-diagonal mean for
  a fixed band.
- **"Are the off-diagonals constant?" is unanswerable without the estimator's
  own scatter.** A time block bootstrap (6 blocks) supplies per-entry standard
  errors; fit quality is a χ² in those units, and everything that reads a
  *shape* off the common term is gated at 3 SE. Without this the raw residual
  is ≈1 no matter how right the model is.

### The control says the estimator does not manufacture a common term

Synthetic locked-phase comb, 4 rotors, demodulated along the **exact**
trajectory, with the OU shaft band-limited at 8 Hz (WP4 item 5's physical
convention), ± a known arrival-time jitter `n(t)`:

| control (8 units each) | fixB1.5 | fixB6 | kscale0.5 |
|---|---|---|---|
| null, 20 dB | −5e-6 ± 1.1e-5 (z −0.4) | −9.7e-5 ± 1.8e-4 (z −0.4) | −1.3e-4 ± 1.8e-4 (z −0.7) |
| null, 0 dB | −1.4e-5 ± 1.5e-5 (z −1.1) | 4.0e-5 ± 2.4e-4 (z 0.2) | 1.6e-4 ± 2.0e-4 (z 0.9) |
| **100 µs jitter, 20 dB** | 1.1e-4 ± 3.6e-5 (z 2.7) | **4.0e-3 ± 6.6e-4 (z 6.2)** | 2.2e-3 ± 5.1e-4 (z 5.2) |

The null reads **zero to within one standard error at every band**, and an
injected shaft jitter is recovered at z = 6.2 with `k* = 15` and a 70 % floor
share. That is what makes the real-data numbers below citable.

*This control only became null after two fixes, both of which matter for real
data.* With the OU drive left white to 250 Hz and the carrier taken off the
0.032 s frame grid, the null measured `σ_c² = 5.3e-3` — **as large as a 100 µs
jitter**. Shaft motion above the frame-grid Nyquist is un-representable, and the
residual FM it leaves is common to every harmonic, so it would have been booked
as `σ_J²`. Hence the carrier is the highest-rate trajectory available (DREGON's
native ~929 Hz `motors_measured`, the synthetic's exact one). *On real DREGON
this turns out not to matter* — the framegrid control job reproduces
`σ_c² = 3.1e-5` (vs 3.1e-5) at B = 1.5 and 8.9e-4 (vs 8.1e-4) at B = 6 — which
independently confirms WP4's reality check that the *synthetic's* drive was the
unphysical part, not real shafts.

### Coverage is the first result: the fixed band starves itself

Usable harmonics of 30 after the twin gate (median over units; DREGON's
median minimum rotor split is **0.42** rev/s, Michael's **1.05**):

| group | units | fixB1.5 | fixB3 | fixB6 | fixB12 | kscale0.1 | kscale0.25 | kscale0.5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DREGON (indoor, 9 windows) | 36 | 20.5 | 19.0 | 15.0 | **0** | 21.0 | 21.0 | 12.0 |
| Michael's (outdoor, 13 windows) | 52 | 19.0 | 18.0 | 14.5 | **1** (4/52 fit at all) | 19.0 | 19.0 | 11.0 |

At a fixed band the twin-collision radius in rev/s is `B/k` — it **shrinks on
exactly the harmonics the weighting favours**. At the `pi_kalman` default
`band_hz = 6` half the comb is already gone; at 12 Hz the harmonic set is
empty on every DREGON unit and all but four of Michael's. This is the same
starvation WP1-B measured from the other side (twin-gated 80–84 %), and it is
an argument for k-scaling on its own: `B_k = k·B_0` holds the collision radius
at `B_0` for every `k`.

### The weight curve — and the stage's weight is effectively flat

`v_k` is smooth, monotone, and nearly identical indoors and outdoors. At
`B = 1.5` Hz it falls by 167× between k = 2 and k = 30; under `B_k = 0.25k` it
is nearly **flat** (0.119 → 0.051 over the same range). Fitted exponents of
`1/v_k ∝ k^α·P_k` (median over units, `P_k` = noise-subtracted in-band
harmonic power; `α_raw` is the same fit *without* the `P_k` term):

| group | arm | α | IQR | R² | α_raw |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DREGON | fixB1.5 | 3.96 | 0.63 | 0.87 | **1.97** |
| DREGON | fixB3 | 3.52 | 0.36 | 0.84 | 2.00 |
| DREGON | fixB6 | 3.60 | 0.98 | 0.75 | 2.00 |
| DREGON | kscale0.25 | 1.39 | 0.35 | 0.58 | 0.29 |
| DREGON | kscale0.5 | 1.67 | 0.62 | 0.60 | 0.29 |
| Michael's | fixB1.5 | 3.02 | 1.18 | 0.75 | **1.50** |
| Michael's | fixB3 | 3.03 | 1.09 | 0.75 | 1.51 |
| Michael's | fixB6 | 3.17 | 1.63 | 0.73 | 1.46 |
| Michael's | kscale0.25 | 0.55 | 0.59 | 0.13 | −0.26 |
| Michael's | kscale0.5 | −0.14 | 0.46 | 0.03 | −0.51 |

Read `α_raw`, because it is the weight itself: **the empirically optimal weight
is `w_k = 1/v_k ∝ k^2.0` (DREGON) / `k^1.5` (Michael's), with NO `|p_k|`
factor.** The stage uses `k²|p_k|`, and on these recordings `|p_k| ∝ k^-2` (the
harmonic amplitudes decay as 1/k), so **the stage's weight is effectively flat
in k where the data says it should rise as k²**. That is the concrete defect:
not the exponent 2, but the extra amplitude factor multiplying it.

Under k-scaling `α_raw` collapses to ≈ 0 — every harmonic carries roughly equal
information — and R² collapses with it (0.03–0.58), i.e. under a k-scaled band
*no power law describes the weight at all*, which is a stronger version of the
INSERT-D claim than it made. The measured exponent SHIFT from fixed to k-scaled
is **−1.7 (DREGON) / −2.0 (Michael's)**, not the predicted −1: the derivation
in INSERT-D neglects the band factor `1 - sinc(2BΔt)` that `pi_kalman` already
carries as `c_noise`, which makes `v_k` scale nearer `B³` than `B`.

### σ_J², k\*, and the floor share — mostly NOT resolved

`σ_J²` (rev²/s²) against the high-pass cutoff, pooled median ± block-bootstrap
SE, with the z of the `f_c = 0` value:

| group | arm | fc=0 | fc=0.5 | fc=1 | fc=2 | fc=3 | z(fc0) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DREGON | fixB1.5 | 3.1e-5 ± 9.2e-5 | 6e-6 ± 9.6e-5 | — | — | — | **0.33** |
| DREGON | fixB3 | 1.7e-4 ± 2.3e-4 | 1.3e-4 | 3.3e-5 | — | — | 0.80 |
| DREGON | fixB6 | 8.1e-4 ± 4.8e-4 | 6.3e-4 | 5.4e-4 | 2.8e-4 | 1.5e-4 | 1.75 |
| Michael's | fixB1.5 | 2.6e-4 ± 1.3e-4 | 1.2e-4 | — | — | — | 1.96 |
| Michael's | fixB3 | 8.1e-4 ± 3.5e-4 | 5.9e-4 | 3.8e-4 | — | — | 2.39 |
| Michael's | fixB6 | 1.1e-3 ± 7.6e-4 | 7.8e-4 | 7.5e-4 | 5.6e-4 | 3.9e-4 | 1.67 |

Per unit, the common term clears 3 SE in **0 of 36** DREGON units and **14 of
52** Michael's units at the stage's narrow band. Consequently:

- **`k*` does not exist within k ≤ 30 on DREGON at all**, and on Michael's it
  lands at 26.5–30 in the 2–4 % of units where it is resolvable. *The
  information does not saturate over the harmonic range the stage uses.*
- The floor share `σ_J²/(1/W + σ_J²)` over `k ≥ 6`, **conditioned on the units
  where the term resolves** (so an upper bound), is 0.20 (DREGON, fixB6) and
  0.35–0.39 (Michael's). At `f_c = 2` it halves, to 0.11 / 0.20.
- The cutoff sweep does not plateau — `σ_J²` keeps falling as the cutoff rises,
  over the whole range the band admits. **The δ/J separation the design asked
  for does not succeed on this data**; every number above is an upper bound on
  the genuinely irreducible part, and the honest reading is that most of the
  common term is slow, i.e. trackable trajectory error rather than a floor.

### Rank-one-plus-diagonal is NOT the right shape — the model is too simple

This is the finding, and it goes against the design.

| group | arm | χ² | excess/σ | rank-1 frac | β | corr(a_k, SNR_k) | corr(C, min k) | corr(C, \|Δk\|) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DREGON | fixB1.5 | 2.51 | 18.0 | 0.23 | — | — | −0.03 | −0.03 |
| DREGON | fixB6 | 2.34 | 2.08 | 0.23 | −1.98 | 0.32 | −0.12 | −0.09 |
| DREGON | kscale0.25 | 2.35 | 5.95 | 0.13 | 0.16 | −0.12 | 0.05 | −0.05 |
| Michael's | fixB1.5 | 4.43 | 4.10 | 0.27 | −1.21 | 0.53 | −0.14 | −0.14 |
| Michael's | fixB6 | 2.83 | 2.95 | 0.25 | −1.52 | 0.49 | −0.13 | −0.10 |
| Michael's | kscale0.25 | 2.66 | 3.20 | 0.15 | −0.23 | 0.21 | −0.005 | −0.14 |

- **The off-diagonals are not constant.** χ² = 2.3–4.4 against 1.0 for a
  constant within estimator noise, and the excess scatter is 1.6–18× the fitted
  common value itself.
- **The best rank-one explains only 12–27 % of the off-diagonal energy.** A
  single shared term does not describe what is there.
- **Where the loading is resolvable it is β ≈ −1.2 to −2.0, not 0.** A *delay*
  disturbance loads uniformly (β = 0); a shared *phase* disturbance would load
  as 1/k (β = −1). The measurement is nearer the phase reading — but
  `corr(a_k, SNR_k) = 0.32–0.53` says the same shape is at least partly the
  wrapped-phase increment decorrelating at the harmonics whose envelope SNR is
  ≈ 1 (see the SNR column of the `v_k` curves: SNR drops to ~1 above k ≈ 12).
  The two cannot be separated at this SNR, and neither supports the uniform
  loading the derivation assumes.
- No clean alternative structure either: the off-diagonals correlate with
  neither `min(i,j)` nor `|i−j|` beyond |r| ≤ 0.16.

**So the INSERT-D consequence that survives is the weight shape (`w_k ∝ 1/v_k`,
measured), and the consequence that does not is the floor.** There is no
well-resolved single common term to put on the diagonal as `W_eff`, and no
saturation harmonic to cap `k` at, on either dataset.

### The indoor/outdoor contrast: half the prediction holds

Prediction: DREGON is indoors and reverberant → a larger *dispersive*
(diagonal, `v_k`) term; Michael's is outdoors → a relatively larger
*delay-like* (rank-one) term.

| quantity | indoor (DREGON) | outdoor (Michael's) | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| σ_c² @ fixB1.5, fc 0 | 8.6e-6 | 4.2e-5 | **4.9×** |
| σ_c² @ fixB3, fc 0 | 7.7e-5 | 1.9e-4 | 2.5× |
| σ_c² @ fixB6, fc 0 | 5.3e-4 | 4.3e-4 | 0.8× |
| median `v_k` @ fixB1.5 | 0.0128 | 0.0135 | 1.05× |
| median `v_k` @ fixB6 | 0.1150 | 0.1170 | 1.02× |
| channel coherence of the common term | **0.065** | **0.237** | 3.6× |

- **The rank-one half holds directionally**: the common term is 2.5–4.9× larger
  outdoors at the narrow bands, and it is 3.6× more coherent across
  microphones there — outdoors the disturbance looks more like one shared
  arrival-time process, indoors it is nearly mic-private. Both point the way
  the model predicts.
- **The dispersive half is refuted.** `v_k` is the same indoors and outdoors to
  within 5 % at every band. Reverberation does not measurably raise the
  per-harmonic term. Note the caveat that cuts the other way too: DREGON is
  room 1 only (`beatvk-valid-raw` carries no room-2 recording), so this is
  "one reverberant room vs outdoors", not the two-room contrast.
- **And the strongest single number contradicts the mechanism outright:** the
  channel coherence is 0.065 / 0.237, against 0.81–0.94 on the synthetic
  control where the jitter is shaft-borne by construction. Shaft timing jitter
  is one number for the whole aircraft and must appear identically at every
  microphone. It does not. Whatever common term exists on real recordings is
  **predominantly per-microphone**, i.e. propagation/turbulence rather than
  shaft jitter — which is also why it is slow enough to keep shrinking as the
  high-pass cutoff rises.

### What this means for the stage

1. **Fix the weight, not the floor.** Replace `k²|p_k|` with the measured
   `1/v_k`. The concrete change is dropping the `|p_k|` factor (or replacing it
   with a per-harmonic SNR term), because `k²|p_k|` is flat in `k` on real
   recordings while the optimum rises as `k^1.5–2.0`.
2. **Do not add a `W_eff` floor and do not cap `k`.** Neither is supported:
   `σ_J²` is unresolved on DREGON and marginal on Michael's, `k*` is beyond the
   harmonic range in use, and the rank-one shape itself fails at χ² 2.3–4.4.
3. **k-scale the band.** It is the only change that improves *coverage* — the
   binding constraint at every band tested — and under it the weight becomes
   flat in `k`, which is a far more robust thing to implement than a fitted
   exponent.
4. **The residual honest gap**: the wrapped-phase decorrelation at SNR ≈ 1
   contaminates both the loading shape and the high-k end of `v_k`. Separating
   it needs either a higher-SNR regime or a von-Mises (not Gaussian) increment
   likelihood; until then the `β ≈ −1` reading must not be quoted as evidence
   for a shared-phase disturbance.

## WP19 — union-comb emission: the subharmonic collapse is fixed, the tracker still loses (2026-07-31)

WP17's failure was diagnosed as an emission defect, and both fixes landed
(`3a43156`): the **union-comb emission** (`union_emission` — each spectrogram
bin counted once however many rotors claim it, so a comb at `c/2` can no longer
bank the teeth it shares with `c`) and the **assignment-level rotor-band prior**
(`_band_penalty` — the seeder's own `r_span_max = 1.45`, soft, applied to the
four-tuple rather than to seed bases).

Measured on the cluster, job **`jbinit2-359409`** (uni-cpu, 45 units, init stage
only, all 15 real protocol windows):

| pool | `fullrange_init` | joint_beam (WP17, sum) | **joint_beam (union + band)** | union, `b0 = 1.0` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| dregon_cruise (9) | **1.98** | 26.03 | 17.41 | 21.27 |
| fly124_cruise (4) | **2.85** | 22.40 | 5.92 | 9.19 |
| ramp (5) | **3.38** | 27.13 | 27.85 | 41.27 |
| steady (10) | **1.87** | 21.56 | 9.21 | 13.30 |

**The fix works, and it is not enough.** The subharmonic collapse is gone —
where WP17 produced `21 / 42 / 85`, every window now returns a physically
plausible four-tuple (all tracks >= 33 rev/s, the band prior rejecting 56 % of
proposals on the ramp window), and FLY124 cruise improves **3.8x**. On the two
best windows the tracker now finds the right rotors outright: w03
`[74.7, 75.5, 90.7, 91.8]` and w04 `[74.3, 75.7, 91.0, 92.3]` against a truth of
`[73.96, 74.85, 80.73, 90.79]` — the twin pair correctly resolved, with the
known comb-invisible ~81 rev/s rotor replaced by a duplicate of the strong 91
comb (the same rotor WP8/WP12 record as recoverable only by arm R's residual
re-scan). But `fullrange_init` still wins every pool, by 2.1x on FLY124 cruise
and 8.8x on DREGON, so the end-of-chain protocol was not run.

Structurally the goal is met and it does not rescue the result: `std_ratio`
1.34 vs the coarse init's 0.33 (0.18 on steady windows, i.e. the trust gate
makes it near-constant lines), and shape-correlation spread 0.79 vs 0.10. The
four rotors genuinely stop sharing one shape — and are still 9x worse in
absolute error. Same lesson as WP17, now on a sound emission.

**The k-scaled analysis bandwidth is settled, negatively, on real data too:**
`b0 = 1.0` is worse than `b0 = 0` in every pool (17.41 -> 21.27, 5.92 -> 9.19),
confirming on the 15-window protocol what the synthetic ceiling already showed.
It is a capture device, and a dense grid search has nothing to capture. (Its
separate claim — that a fixed bandwidth leaves no usable harmonics under a twin
gate — stands and is WP18's territory, not this stage's.)

### Why this is the place to stop

The remaining gap is not the prior (WP17's arithmetic caps its contribution at
~1 cost unit against an emission budget of 6000) and no longer the emission's
double-counting. It is that a seedless full-range search has to solve, from the
score surface alone and in one pass, the problem the existing chain solves with
a seeder plus four downstream repair stages: `blind_seed`'s alias filters and
octave check, the trust gates, M1's sibling masking, M2, and M3's verified
re-seed. Each of those exists because a measurement demanded it. Replacing all
of them at once was the wrong unit of change; the shared-shape defect WP3
identified is real but was never the binding constraint.

`joint_beam` stays in the tree as a tested, documented negative result and a
reusable component (the union emission and the band prior are both independently
useful, and `comb_tables` is a cheap exact tooth-level scorer). It is **not** a
production candidate.

### Reconciling WP16's "isotropic" with WP17's fitted anisotropy

The two sections measure different things and only appear to disagree.

WP16 measured **raw per-frame increments** and found them isotropic
(sigma_c/sigma_d = 0.97-1.07 on DREGON). WP17's **autocovariance fit excludes
lag 0**, and therefore the label noise, giving implied differential `s` of
0.08-0.38 against a common `s` of 0.32-1.19 — a ratio near 3.

DREGON's telemetry is the reason. `motors_measured` is a reciprocal-period
lattice with a **0.28 rev/s step at 80 rev/s, updated at 44 Hz**, so the
quantisation noise is (a) comparable in size to the true 32 ms increments and
(b) isotropic across rotors by construction. It therefore dominates the raw
increment statistic and drags every mode's sigma to the same value, masking the
real anisotropy. Michael's telemetry (1 RPM = 0.0168 rev/s, quantisation-free at
this scale) already showed the raw ratio rising to 1.6-1.9, which is the same
story at a lower noise level.

Both statements are correct as measured, and the practical conclusion is
unchanged: WP16's verdict was about the **increment** prior, which is the
quantity the raw statistic bounds, and that verdict survives — a first-order
Markov prior on increments cannot express a level anisotropy no matter how the
noise is handled. WP17's fit is what a mean-reversion term needs, and its own
magnitude arithmetic is what rules it out.

### Verification: `rps_refine_lab` is trustworthy again

The WP17 note that byte-identity of the existing chains was structural but
unconfirmed is now closed. Same job, after the sweep: `--chain baseline` on both
canonical windows reproduces the references exactly —
**dregon_ramp 3.262 (trace 3.262) PASS, tgrid 3.214 PASS; fly124_cruise 0.978
(post-WP15 reference 0.978) PASS, tgrid 0.966 PASS**. The `skip_dp` parameter
added to `run_ladder` for `joint_beam` does not disturb any existing chain.

## WP20 — the objective, not the search: the tracker is right and the ask is wrong (2026-08-01)

The WP19 negative result left one question open, and it is the one the whole
joint-tracker line stands on: a beam search whose hypothesis space CONTAINS the
staged chain's answer should not lose to it.  That objection is correct, and
this measures which of the only two explanations holds.

A tracker can be wrong two ways, and they need opposite fixes:

- the SEARCH fails to find the best trajectory under its objective — fix the
  proposals, the beam width, the diversity;
- the OBJECTIVE prefers the wrong trajectory — no search budget can help, and
  a *better* search makes the answer *worse*.

`scripts/jb_probe.py --mode cost` decides it directly, by evaluating the
tracker's own accumulated cost at trajectories the tracker did not produce
(`joint_beam_tracker.score_trajectory`, pinned in the unit tests against the
test file's independent reimplementation of the same cost).

### The verdict: objective, on 6 of 6 windows, by ~2x

| window | cost(GT) | cost(fullrange_init) | cost(joint_beam) | MAE fri | MAE jb |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| FLY124 w3 | -1853 | -1077 | **-3654** | 1.43 | 3.16 |
| FLY124 w4 | -2101 | -1373 | **-3648** | 1.15 | 3.17 |
| DREGON nosource w0 (ramp) | **+100** | -1089 | **-3021** | 3.45 | 27.61 |
| DREGON nosource w1 | -504 | -1465 | **-3203** | 1.15 | 8.84 |
| DREGON speech-low w1 | -278 | -921 | **-2871** | 1.04 | 12.82 |
| synth_trace | -3239 | — | **-3998** | — | 1.28 |

The ordering is exactly inverted on every window: the trajectory with **zero**
error is the DEAREST, the stage that wins on accuracy sits in the middle, and
the beam's own output — 27.6 rev/s of error on the ramp — is by far the
cheapest.  The beam is not losing the answer.  It is finding excellent minima
of a badly wrong objective, and every representational improvement (wider beam,
marginal coverage, better proposals) would move it further from the truth.

### Which term, and by how much

| window | GT emis / trans | JB emis / trans | comb mass GT / JB |
|---|---|---|---|
| FLY124 w3 | -2018 / 166 | -3778 / 123 | 3.63 / 3.50 |
| DREGON w0 (ramp) | -1290 / 1390 | -3257 / 228 | 2.65 / 3.68 |
| DREGON w1 | -1811 / 1307 | -3337 / 134 | 3.18 / 3.62 |
| speech-low w1 | -1396 / 1118 | -3095 / 224 | 3.19 / 3.50 |

**The emission is the dominant defect and it stands alone** — it prefers the
beam's output by 1500-2000 units on every window, which is more than the whole
gap.  It is NOT that the beam claims more distinct combs: claimed comb mass is
comparable (2.65-3.63 GT vs 3.50-3.68 JB).  It claims combs that are *louder*.
Read in normalised units, GT's four true rotors together collect 0.86 comb-units
per frame on the ramp where 1.0 is the frame's single best comb — the true
speeds sit barely above the per-frame **median** of the score surface.

**The transition prior is a second, smaller defect, and it is dataset-specific.**
GT costs 1118-1390 on the three DREGON windows against the beam's 134-228, so
the prior is roughly 10x too stiff for the frame-level roughness of DREGON's
labels; at FLY124 cruise the two agree (166 vs 123).  Part of that is real
motion and part is DREGON's reciprocal-period label noise (WP16), so the
comparison slightly flatters the beam — score a SMOOTHED GT before quoting a
number from it.

### The emission ceiling, measured independently

`--mode ceiling` asks the upstream question with no tracker in the loop: for
each (rotor, frame), is the truth proposable (a local maximum within 0.5 rev/s
surviving into the top-`n_peaks` NMS shortlist — ACQUISITION), and does a local
move from the truth at `t-1` land on the truth at `t` (TRACKING)?  Worst rotor
per window, over ten analysis configurations:

| cfg | FLY124 w3 | FLY124 w4 | nosrc w0 | nosrc w1 | speech w1 | synth |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| shipped (2048, k8) | 0.114 | 0.176 | 0.218 | 0.226 | 0.214 | 0.541 |
| nfft4096 k16 (best) | 0.234 | **0.367** | 0.313 | 0.355 | 0.311 | **0.697** |
| nfft4096 k30 step 0.25 | 0.192 | 0.267 | **0.394** | **0.363** | **0.361** | 0.513 |
| nfft8192 k50 | 0.196 | 0.230 | 0.220 | 0.253 | 0.273 | 0.261 |

Three things follow, and they agree with the cost verdict:

1. **The shipped emission can propose the worst rotor on 11-23% of frames.**
   No search can track what it cannot propose one frame in five.
2. **Resolution is not the fix.**  The best of ten configurations reaches only
   31-39%, i.e. ~1.6x, and past k=30 more harmonics LOSE it again — a slewing
   rotor smears its high teeth across the analysis window faster than the extra
   resolution buys.
3. **The control kills the SNR explanation.**  On the clean synthetic, with
   locked phases and rotors 3.9 rev/s apart, the worst rotor is still only 54%
   proposable.  The score function is weak where the data is perfect.

### What the mechanism is, and what changes next

The score is a weighted MEAN over teeth of `white[k*c] - max(white[(k-0.5)*c], 0)`.
A mean rewards ANY loud content at multiples of `c`: a comb with four loud teeth
and twelve absent ones scores like one with sixteen medium teeth.  Nothing in it
says *most of the predicted teeth are actually there* — which is precisely the
property that separates a rotor from a coincidence, and precisely why a quiet
true rotor loses to a spurious placement riding a loud neighbour's harmonics.

### The pooling sweep: measured, and it is the biggest single lever so far

`EmissionCfg.pool` becomes a measured knob — `"mean"` (the shipped form,
bit-identical), `"quantile"` (the `pool_q` quantile of the per-tooth contrast)
and `"frac_pos"` (the weighted fraction of teeth with positive contrast).
Worst-rotor ACQUISITION, per window and averaged (job `python-d65bd8`):

| cfg | FLY124 w3 | FLY124 w4 | nosrc w0 | nosrc w1 | speech w1 | synth | mean |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| shipped (mean, 2048, k8) | 0.128 | 0.190 | 0.232 | 0.216 | 0.214 | 0.591 | 0.262 |
| best resolution-only (4096, k16) | 0.255 | 0.367 | 0.331 | 0.351 | 0.305 | 0.687 | 0.383 |
| **quantile q=0.25, 4096, k16** | **0.319** | **0.497** | 0.388 | 0.361 | **0.393** | **0.731** | **0.448** |
| quantile q=0.25, 4096, k30 | 0.293 | 0.427 | 0.283 | 0.297 | 0.343 | 0.689 | 0.389 |
| frac_pos, 4096, k16 | 0.226 | 0.375 | 0.299 | 0.383 | 0.327 | 0.635 | 0.374 |
| frac_pos, 4096, k50 | 0.152 | 0.198 | 0.228 | 0.204 | 0.244 | 0.275 | 0.217 |

Quantile pooling at `q = 0.25` with `k <= 16` is best on five of six windows and
2.5x shipped on the two hardest (0.128 -> 0.319, 0.190 -> 0.497).  TRACKING
moves less — 0.312 shipped -> 0.377 — which is consistent with the mechanism:
the pooling fixes *which candidate wins*, not how much evidence a frame carries.
`frac_pos` is consistently worse than `quantile`, so the MAGNITUDE of a tooth
carries information a present/absent threshold discards, and it degrades badly
with `k` (0.217 at k=50) because a thresholded count is dominated by the many
weak high teeth.

(Note when comparing with the first sweep: the probe now applies the emission's
own `smooth_frames` before scoring, worth a uniform +0.014 — the earlier table
measured an unsmoothed surface.)

### Carrying it into the union: QUALITY x SHARE

A quantile is not a weighted sum, so the union had to be generalised, and two
plausible forms are wrong in ways the unit tests caught before any cluster time:

- *count the live rotors as the mass* — four coincident combs make four
  identical claims per bin, the dedup awards each surviving tooth to an
  arbitrary row, and the teeth scatter over three rotors, which then each
  contribute a full comb's score: a degenerate assignment scored **3x** instead
  of 1x;
- *pool over the SURVIVING teeth* — the union deletes a different subset from
  every rotor, so a quantile over what is left is not comparable between them,
  and the spread assignment scored BELOW the degenerate one (-0.022 vs +0.108),
  reintroducing exactly the collapse the union exists to prevent.

The form that works separates the two jobs: **quality** is pooled over the
rotor's OWN teeth (an intrinsic property of the comb hypothesis — "are most of
my predicted teeth actually there?", which is what kills a subharmonic whose odd
teeth are absent), and **share** is the fraction of its comb mass no other rotor
already claimed (the anti-double-counting).  It reduces exactly to the shipped
weighted sum at `pool="mean"`.

One weakness is characterised rather than papered over
(`test_quantile_pooling_is_sensitive_to_a_contaminated_half_tooth_reference`):
on an unmasked, equal-amplitude, harmonically related toy (72/80/88/96) the
lowest rotor's half-tooth reference lands on its siblings' teeth and a low
quantile is driven by exactly those worst teeth, so it prefers the degenerate
assignment there.  It does not fire on non-harmonic bases, and quantile wins on
every real window — so it states when sibling masking must precede the pooling,
not a reason to drop it.

`EmissionCfg.pool` therefore becomes a measured knob — `"mean"` (the shipped
form, bit-identical), `"quantile"` (the `pool_q` quantile of the per-tooth
contrast: a real comb keeps most teeth, a coincidence collapses) and
`"frac_pos"` (the weighted fraction of teeth with positive contrast) — swept
with `--mode ceiling`, whose acquisition/tracking numbers are objective-free
and therefore a fast, honest optimisation loop.  The gate before any tracker
re-run is the cost probe flipping: GT must become CHEAPER than the beam's own
output.

### Two beam-representation findings, recorded but not acted on

The diagnosis makes both premature.  They are kept because they are measured.

- **Permutation-merged dedup is NOT free.**  It looked exact — emission and
  transition cost are both permutation-invariant — and the unit test refuted it:
  `mu` is inherited from each state's own ancestry, so two states that are
  permutations of each other now can carry trims that are not, and merging
  discards a live hypothesis (`final_cost_best` -226.08 merged vs -227.04).
  Shipped OFF (`BeamCfg.dedup_sorted`).
- **The beam's per-rotor marginal is the representational bound.**  `width`
  states drawn by joint cost from a `len(grid)^4` space give each rotor about
  `width^(1/4)` distinct values — 4 per rotor at `width = 256`.
  `beam_marginal_min_mean` now reports it, and `BeamCfg.diversity_reserve`
  reallocates slots to marginal coverage.  Both wait on the objective.

### Closure (2026-08-03): the joint-tracker line is CLOSED on evidence

The decisive arms ran the shared-peaks proposal family together with the comb
price (`q25_shared`, `q25_claim90_shared`, `q25_claim95_shared`; jobs
python-f49d5d / python-009564 / python-e80317).  The reachable hypothesis
space now contains shared-comb assignments and the price makes a spurious
fourth comb expensive — the two halves the WP20 analysis said had to move
together.  Result: the tracker's output is **bit-identical to the frozen
baseline on all six windows** in all three arms (pooled MAE 6.643 / 5.241 /
21.665 / 8.733 / 8.335 / 0.437), and the objective still ranks the ground
truth DEARER than the beam's own output on 5 of 6 windows at every price.
Two fixes that provably improved the objective on paper (quantile pooling,
`claim_q`) never changed a single output frame.  Nothing remains to tune:
the joint product-space design cannot express the repair.

Successor: `data_processing/rotor_dp.py` + `scripts/sr_dp_probe.py` (WP21) —
exact per-rotor lattice DP (zero search error in the 1-D space) with
claim-masked residual emission, beam retained only over the extraction tree.
First probe run already localised the next defect to exact-bin claim masking
(a claimed comb survives as its own mainlobe flanks; fixed by dilating the
claim to +-2 bins) — a defect the joint tracker's union shares by
construction, and one more reason its comb accounting could not separate
four rotors.


## WP21 — exact per-rotor lattice DP: zero search error, and the defects it exposed (2026-08-03)

The WP20 closure's successor design, restructured on one observation: the
joint tracker's every pathology (union accounting, share, comb pricing,
proposal reachability, the ``width^(1/4)`` marginal) exists only because the
search space is the 4-rotor PRODUCT.  For one rotor the state is a scalar on
a ~1000-point grid, so exact banded Viterbi is milliseconds per window and
the objective-vs-search question dissolves: with exact inference, every
failure is the objective's.  Beam search survives at the level where the
combinatorics actually live — the extraction/assignment tree — not over
frames.

Code: `data_processing/rotor_dp.py` (`viterbi_path` exact within a hard
±5 rev/s/frame band, Huber transition so ramps pay linear; `residual_scores`
= single-comb quantile pooling with claimed bins excluded — the sequential
replacement for the union machinery; `greedy_peel`).  Probe:
`scripts/sr_dp_probe.py`, three arms per window — `oracle_masked` (each
rotor tracked with its three siblings claimed at GT: the individual-rotor
gate), `raw_dp`, `greedy_peel` (scored with `stage_metrics`, directly
comparable to the WP19/WP20 scoreboard).  Emission: the WP20 ceiling winner
(n_fft 4096, k <= 16, quantile q = 0.25), grid step 0.1.  Exactness of the
DP is unit-tested against brute-force enumeration.  Runtime: ~11 s per 16 s
window on a P100 including all three arms — comfortably real-time.

### Run 1 (exact-bin masking): the claim mask, not the emission, was the defect

Every oracle-masked DP reproduced the raw unmasked trajectory bit-for-bit,
and the greedy peel parked all four tracks within 0.4 rev/s of one comb
(FLY124: 91.00/91.09/91.38/91.09).  Mechanism, reproduced in a unit test: a
candidate displaced 0.2-0.4 rev/s from a claimed comb has its high-k teeth
on the ADJACENT rounded bin — inside the claimed tooth's Hann mainlobe — so
a claimed comb survives as its own flanks.  This is the displaced-comb
phenomenon of the beat-VK doc, and the joint tracker's union shares the
defect by construction (its bin identity is the same rounding).

### Run 2 (mask dilated to the mainlobe, ±2 bins): the oracle gate PASSES where a comb is visible

- **Synthetic**: all four rotors MAE 0.67-0.83, hit@1.0 0.73-0.81.
- **Speech window**: all four rotors MAE 1.2-3.1.
- **FLY124 rotor 0**: MAE 0.54, hit@1.0 0.87.
- **Greedy peel un-collapsed** (pair separation 0.7-2.4 rev/s) and moved the
  scoreboard for the first time in the campaign: pooled 3.32 / 3.08 on the
  steady DREGON / speech windows vs the joint beam's 8.73 / 8.34
  (fullrange_init: 1.15 / 1.04).

The residual failures are three separable mechanisms, no longer one mush:

1. **Magnitude-invisible rotors** (FLY124 r1-r3, raw support ≈ 0): the comb
   is not in the spectrogram, so no per-rotor search can find it.  This is
   the entire reason fullrange_init still wins FLY124 — its shared-shape
   band prior parks the missing rotors near the visible one.  The fix lives
   at the tree/leaf level (structural prior for unsupported rotors), not in
   the emission.
2. **Twin dilation deadzone**: a 0.5 rev/s DREGON twin has ALL its k <= 16
   teeth inside the ±2-bin dilation of its claimed sibling, so once the
   sibling is claimed the twin is unfindable and its DP falls to a
   subharmonic (oracle MAE 46).  Twins clear the dilation only from
   k ≈ 20 — the masked stages need k_max ~30 even though the unmasked
   ceiling preferred 16.
3. **Ramp smearing** (room1:0, unchanged ~19-20): at 256 ms windows a
   ramping comb smears its k >= 4 teeth across bins.  The n_fft 2048
   control REFUTED the short-window fix: at 7.8 Hz bins the same ±2-bin
   dilation wipes every neighbour's comb (oracle MAE 25-46 everywhere), and
   the ramp does not improve either.  Ramps need a different mechanism
   (IF-based or adaptive-window emission), not a global window change.

Run 2 also showed the dilated mask's own residual hole: an impostor
0.7 rev/s out keeps just 3 surviving teeth (k = 14-16) and still pools
positive off the claimed teeth's jitter-broadened skirts (linewidth grows
with k and exceeds the window mainlobe).  Fix shipped: floor any speed with
fewer than `min_surv_teeth = 4` survivors (unit-tested: the 0.7 impostor
floors, a 0.9 twin survives).  Arms in flight: k16 + floor (isolate the
floor), k30 + floor (open the twin deadzone).

### Visibility correction (measured): "invisible" was too strong, "faint" is right

Direct measurement of the raw q25 comb score AT each rotor's GT, as a rank
within the per-frame score distribution (FLY124 w3; step 0.1, k <= 16):
r0 (91.5 rev/s, dominant) rank 0.96 / top-5% on 77 % of frames; r1 (73.9)
0.87 / 42 %; r3 (75.9) 0.85 / 29 %; r2 (81.8) 0.69 / 10 %.  So FLY124's
non-dominant rotors are **present and often in the top 5 %**, merely
outranked in a typical frame by ~100+ grid speeds of junk around the
dominant comb (skirts + subharmonic family) — the exact junk the survivor
floor de-scores.  They are NOT twin-blended (2 rev/s apart separates from
k = 5 under the dilation).  The genuine twin-blend class is DREGON's steady
window: two true pairs at 0.43 and 0.81 rev/s separation.  Two further
notes: the blind VK residual re-scan previously annotated all four FLY124
rotors to ~1 rev/s, so the information is in the signal and the magnitude
readout is the limiting factor; and `whitened_spec` MEANS over the 8 mics,
diluting a rotor visible on few channels — per-channel pooling is an
untried lever.  (Also: the "local max within +-0.5" ceiling statistic is
misleading at step 0.1 — even the dominant rotor's GT is a strict local max
on only ~8 % of frames.)

### Resume state (2026-08-03 — session checkpoint)

Standing goal (cleared from the session, restate to resume): *make the
iterative RPS refinement actually precise — near-perfect on synthetic, much
better on Michael's data*; active subgoal per the user: *make sure that
search for individual rotors works well* (compute budget 3x realtime GPU,
stay inside the beam-search idea).

**In-flight** (kaggle, commit `d3d4387`, submitted 2026-08-03, still queued
behind other jobs at checkpoint time — check `omnirun ps`, pull with
`omnirun pull <job>`):

- `python-1ff374` — probe with k_max 16 + `min_surv_teeth 4`
  (`results/sr_dp_probe_k16ms4`).  Prediction: FLY124 greedy collapse at
  ~91 breaks; r1/r3 oracle MAE drops from 16.8/14.6 toward the faint-comb
  level; DREGON twins still fail (deadzone untouched at k16).
- `python-e8e85c` — same + k_max 30 (`results/sr_dp_probe_k30ms4`).
  Prediction: DREGON twin oracle MAE 46 -> low single digits; whether the
  k30 base surface degrades the easy rotors is the open question.

**Frozen comparison rows** (pooled MAE, windows in `jb_probe.WINDOWS`
order): joint_beam 6.64 / 5.24 / 21.66 / 8.73 / 8.34 / 0.44; fullrange_init
1.43 / 1.15 / 3.45 / 1.15 / 1.04 / —; greedy_peel run 2 (dilated mask, no
floor) 10.65 / 15.81 / 19.05 / 3.32 / 3.08 / 1.82.

**Next-step ladder** (in order, each gated on the previous):
1. Read the two arms; update the run-2 failure taxonomy per rotor.
2. If FLY124 stays faint-limited: per-channel pooling in `whitened_spec`
   (max or top-quantile over mics instead of mean) — one probe arm.
3. K-best distinct-mode extraction per peel level + beam over the
   extraction tree + union/`claim_q` leaf scoring (the structural prior for
   unsupported rotors lives HERE — a band prior fallback like
   fullrange_init's, so FLY124's faint rotors get parked near the visible
   comb instead of on junk).
4. Ramp windows: separate mechanism (IF-based or adaptive-window emission);
   the n_fft 2048 control refuted the global short-window fix.
5. Hand winning trajectories to `refine_v2/v3` (one pi_kalman pass) and
   score on the beat-VK protocol against the 0.688 / 1.027 bars.

## Work packages

- **WP0 — lab harness** `scripts/rps_refine_lab.py`: repo-ified
  trace_pipeline with configurable stage chains + a synthetic free-flight
  battery (N seeds × aggressiveness), per-stage PIT-MAE + per-rotor
  bias/shape decomposition, JSON out. Fast CPU iteration.
- **WP1 — diagnosis**: instrument `_freq_update` (which factor zeroes the
  step) and pi_kalman (per-iteration capture fractions, in-band offsets).
- **WP2 — aggressive pi_kalman**: sweep n_iter / band_hz schedule
  (wide→narrow) / k_caps / sigma_process / max_step / pair_mode on the
  synthetic battery; target MAE < 0.1 synthetic; transfer to fly124. Decide
  whether VK capture+refine survive at all or the chain becomes
  ladder → iterated pi_kalman.
- **WP3 — per-rotor decoupling**: individuate shapes on dregon_ramp
  (wide-band early pi_kalman rounds; per-rotor corridor Viterbi around
  c(t) if needed). Success = per-rotor pred-std tracks gt-std.
- **WP4 — protocol**: best chain on the fixed beatvk-valid-raw protocol,
  scoreboard row in `docs/experiments/beat-vk.md`.

Success bars: synthetic battery pooled PIT-MAE < 0.1 rev/s; fly124_cruise
well under 1.0 (mind the ~29 Hz telemetry jitter floor of GT — estimate it
by comparing raw vs smoothed telemetry before claiming a floor); dregon_ramp
per-rotor std ratio ≈ 1.


## WP18 follow-up — the line-shape readings of `tracking/phase_noise.py` (moved from `src/tracking/AGENTS.md`, 2026-09)

`phase_noise.py` measures the harmonic-common jitter term `sigma_J^2` against the per-harmonic
terms `v_k` (WP18 above — the evidence behind the `VKConfig.freq_weight` shape). Its data side
(recordings + window selection) is injected by the caller; the WP18 campaign's own window builder
(`scripts/phase_noise_cov/`) was retired with the campaign, so a new caller supplies its own
windows. It also holds the four readings the STOCHASTIC COMB model is written from — a Lorentzian line per harmonic with `gamma_k = gamma_0 + s k` (`data_processing.stochastic_rotor_noise`). They read the same envelopes, so the two measurements cannot disagree about what a harmonic is:

| Primitive | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `arm_increments(dm, arm) -> ArmSeries` | the first half of `arm_covariance`, extracted: one arm's gated `delta_k(t)`. `arm_covariance(..., series=)` takes it back, so a second reading of the same opinions rebuilds nothing |
| `envelope_acf(z, fs_env, ...)` | normalized complex autocorrelation of an envelope, with the brickwall floor removed as `noise_power * sinc(2 B lag)` at EVERY lag |
| `coherence_time` / `linewidth` | the `exp(-1)` crossing and `gamma = 1 / (2 pi tau)`, plus the CENSORING flag and the secondary `acf_slope_width` |
| `acf_slope_width` | the width from the LOG SLOPE of the same curve — the estimator a line too narrow to cross still has |
| `fit_linewidth_law(k, gamma, method=)` | `gamma_k = gamma_0 + s k`, by least squares or by Theil-Sen |
| `median_by_k(k, gamma, min_count=)` | the per-harmonic MEDIAN width and its count — what the law is fitted on |
| `gap_filter(x, valid, band_hz, fs_env, high=)` | THE brickwall of a gated series, gaps interpolated over; both cutoff sweeps read through it |
| `welch_envelope(z, fs_env, target_df=)` | the two-sided averaged periodogram of a complex envelope, NOT detrended |
| `fit_line_shape(f, p, hwhm0=)` | Lorentzian against Gaussian at the SAME half width, fitted in the log domain — the verdict is about the TAIL |
| `cross_harmonic_correlation(series, smooth_hz=)` | the covariance as a CORRELATION, and `rho_k` — harmonic `k` against the other admitted ones, at one LOW-pass smoothing bandwidth |
| `shared_rate_opinion(series, v_k, k_used)` | the inverse-variance weighted mean `c(t)`, so `e_k = delta_k - c` is definable |
| `residual_tail_stats(e)` | excess kurtosis plus the per-sample Cauchy-against-Gaussian LLR of the pooled residual |
| `K_BANDS` | the reporting bands `k1_5` / `k6_15` / `k16_30` |

Three things a caller must know:

- **The line measurement needs its OWN envelope grid.** At `gamma_k = 0.6 k` the k=30 line has a coherence time of 8.8 ms, which is half a sample on WP18's 62.5 Hz grid. `scripts/phase_coherence_probe.py` demodulates twice per rotor — once at 500 Hz for the width and the shape, once at `FS_ENV` for the covariance — rather than moving WP18's grid.
- **A censored reading is not a measurement.** A bench motor held at a setpoint stays correlated past 1 s, so `gamma_hz` is `nan` and `gamma_bound_hz` is an UPPER bound. Report the censored fraction beside the fitted law, and read `gamma_slope_hz` where the crossing is absent.
- **`rho_k` is a CURVE in a smoothing bandwidth, and `cross_harmonic_correlation`'s `smooth_hz` LOW-passes where `arm_covariance`'s `cutoffs` HIGH-pass.** The two directions answer different questions. WP18 high-passes because the trajectory error and the shaft jitter are confounded at low frequency, so the fast band is where a common term can only be jitter. A shared SHAFT disturbance is itself slow, so at the raw 62.5 Hz frame rate it sits under the per-harmonic measurement noise: the first full run of the probe read `rho_k` ~ 0.001 in every condition. Smoothing to `B` Hz averages that noise down by about `sqrt(fs_env / 2B)`. Quote the bandwidth with the number or the number says nothing.
- **The law is fitted on per-harmonic MEDIANS, robustly.** A pooled least squares over the raw width cloud is owned by the harmonics that were measured once: on the DREGON motor set `k` = 1 and `k` = 9 read 10-11 Hz off one window each and took the slope to 0.014 Hz per order at an R squared of 0.003, while the medians of the harmonics measured five times or more rise cleanly from 0.22 Hz at `k` = 8 to 1.47 Hz at `k` = 30. `median_by_k` then `fit_linewidth_law(method="theilsen")`.
- **The width estimate wants a stricter SNR gate than the covariance does.** The autocorrelation is normalized by the line power AFTER the floor is subtracted, so at SNR ~ 1 that denominator is a small difference of similar numbers and the curve reads above 1. The probe gates at SNR 3 (measured: at 1.3 the curve reached 1.85), against WP18's `MIN_SNR` = 1.

Driver: `scripts/phase_coherence_probe.py` — one gridrun unit per (condition, recording, window, rotor) over the DREGON motor bench, the four-motor bench, and the TRAIN-split free flight (DREGON room 2 + FLY125). Two things it learned the hard way, both now in the driver's own constants: the LINE BAND sets the twin-collision gate, so a 25 Hz band on a four-rotor recording admits 0-3 harmonics per rotor against 4-20 at 10 Hz (measured on its own refined references); and four rotors within about 1 rev/s are ONE comb at any band a 20 s window resolves, so that condition is measured on the mean of the four refined rates with no gate at all.
