"""Michael's drone-noise source — uniform registry entry.

8-channel DJI Matrice 100 in-flight recordings + flight-controller CSV logs
(per-motor rotation speed in RPM), aligned via per-file ``time_offset`` /
``time_dilation`` constants and value-calibrated via ``MICHAELS_RPS_SCALE``.
All three are MEASURED, not hand-tuned — see the block comment above
``MICHAELS_FILES`` and ``docs/experiments/rps-refine-precision.md`` §§ WP13/WP14.

Raw layout (dload dataset ``recording_with_motor_speed``):
  - ``recording_1/124.wav`` + ``recording_1/FLY124.csv``
  - ``recording_2/125.wav`` + ``recording_2/FLY125.csv``

:func:`build` yields one rich ``tdframe-v1`` Frame per recording: native-sr
8-ch audio realigned to the flight-log clock (window cut + leading-gap fix +
``time_offset``/``time_dilation``), the canonical ``rps`` track (rev/s,
carrying the measured ``MICHAELS_RPS_SCALE`` calibration), plus
*every* remaining CSV column as aligned series on the same time base — numeric
columns grouped per logical sensor block (``IMU_ATTI(0):*`` → ``imu_atti``,
``Motor:Speed:*`` → ``motor_speed``, ...) as ``(channel, time)`` Series with
the original column names as channel labels; boolean/string columns as one
``(time,)`` Series each. Rows where a block logged nothing (DatCon merges
sensors of different rates into one table) are dropped per block, so each
block keeps its true sample times. The non-temporal ``Attribute|Value`` pairs
go into the frame meta.

# ── Measured alignment / label calibration (2026-07-31) ─────────────────────
#
# Referee: the LABEL-FREE Vold-Kalman reconstruction residual
# ||x - x_hat||/||x|| (k = 1..30, `scripts/michaels_calib/calib.py:RECON_CFG`,
# identical to `rps_refine_lab.RECON_CFG`) of the harmonic model built ALONG a
# candidate telemetry trajectory, scored on contiguous 16 s windows of the
# frozen beat-VK window protocol. Only the TELEMETRY is shifted/scaled; our own
# blind RPS estimate is never consulted. Sweep: `scripts/michaels_calib/`.
#
# TIMING — both recordings show a clock DILATION error (the audio-optimal lag
# drifts linearly with time), not a constant offset. Folding lag(t) = a + b·t
# into the loader's parameterisation gives
#     time_dilation_new = time_dilation_old / (1 - b)
#     time_offset_new   = time_offset_old  - a / (1 - b)
# FLY124: 4 cruise windows, b = +0.65356 ms/s, R^2 0.942, residual RMS 2.90 ms
# vs 12.04 ms constant-lag. FLY125: 9 windows, b = +0.37656 ms/s, R^2 0.923,
# residual RMS 4.49 ms vs 16.19 ms.
#
# VALUE — the logged speeds are LOW by ~0.55-0.65 rev/s at cruise. Additive vs
# multiplicative is statistically UNRESOLVED; we ship the MULTIPLICATIVE form
# on physical grounds: these frames cover the WHOLE recording including warm-up
# and ground idle, where an additive +0.6 rev/s would corrupt a near-stationary
# rotor's label while a scale correctly vanishes as rps -> 0.
#
# MAGNITUDE (refit, WP14) — one global fit per recording over ALL 13 cruise
# windows, non-twin rotors only: g = 0.698 % ± 0.069 (FLY124), 0.706 % ± 0.034
# (FLY125). The two agree to 0.008 pp. Per-rotor constants are NOT identifiable.
#
# DEGENERACY — the global gain is not separable from a sample-clock error, so
# it is a *label-for-this-audio* correction, not proof the ESC is miscalibrated.

#
# FLY103 / FLY108 are the only two further recordings of the same rig and the
# same airframe (DatCon attribute ``ACType|M100``). They are **MONO** — one
# microphone, not the 8-channel ring — and their flight logs are ~2x longer
# than the audio, so the audio is a sub-window of the log.
#
# They use the ANCHORED alignment path (``anchor=True`` of
# :func:`load_raw_aligned`): ``time_offset`` is the flight-log clock time of
# the audio's first sample and the telemetry stamps become
# ``(t_log - time_offset) * time_dilation`` — the audio clock, exactly. The
# legacy path of FLY124/FLY125 instead crops the audio head and then uses the
# log stamps as-is, which only agrees with the audio clock because those two
# logs happen to start ~0.15 s before their audio. Here the logs start 50-78 s
# early, so that identity does not hold and the anchored path is mandatory.
#
# (wav_path, csv_path, time_offset_sec, time_dilation) — paths are relative to
# the raw root (the `new-drone-noises` tree).
# COARSE constants (`scripts/michaels_calib/coarse_align.py`, 2026-08-24):
# the comb-score line fit over 5 segments, residual RMS 1.9 ms (FLY103) and
# 3.4 ms (FLY108), whole-recording score +5.6 % / +6.1 % over the best single
# offset at dilation 1. Both recordings agree on a 1.19 % clock dilation to 5
# decimal places, which is 7x FLY125's and 20x FLY124's.
# FINE CALIBRATION (2026-08-24, `scripts/michaels_calib/fit_new.py`, job
# michaels-fit-new-6743bd): per-window audio-optimal lag via the VK
# reconstruction residual, linear lag model folded into the anchored
# constants. Residual lag RMS 2.53 ms over 5 windows (FLY103) and 1.11 ms
# over 4 windows (FLY108) — the same level as the FLY124/125 fits (2.9 /
# 4.5 ms). The fine constants agree with the coarse pass to 7 ms offset and
# 1e-4 dilation. The rev/s scales are in MICHAELS_RPS_SCALE below.
