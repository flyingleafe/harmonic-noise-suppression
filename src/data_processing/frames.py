Ports the old ``TimeFrame.tags`` / ``TimeFrame.global_data`` conventions to
``tdseries``: per-recording scalar metadata lives in a nested *invariant*
``td.Frame`` under the entry name ``"meta"`` (it survives time slicing
untouched); geometry arrays live under ``"mic_pos"`` / ``"rotor_pos"`` as
``td.wrap``-ed Series sharing the ``"mic"`` / ``"rotor"`` dim with the audio

    Published frames datasets (``DREGON-frames`` / ``michaels-frames`` / any
    :mod:`data_processing.sources` builder output) carry their fixes baked in
    — DREGON's ``motors_command`` is already ``clean_command_spikes``-cleaned
    and michaels' ``rps`` is already aligned. The rotor track is therefore
    stored under the generic ``rps`` name, which ``mixing.resolve_motor_tracks``
    treats as needing **no** cleaning, so no fix logic is ever re-applied at
    load time. Everything else (IMU, raw telemetry, geometry, per-sample
    clocks) is dropped so pools keep only what they slice; audio is
    soxr-resampled to ``sample_rate``. Returns ``None`` for frames without
    audio or a rotor track (e.g. clean-source recordings).

    ``rps_key`` chooses WHICH published rotor track becomes the label.
    ``None`` takes the first of :data:`PUBLISHED_RPS_KEYS` the frame carries —
    the raw telemetry. An explicit name (``"rps_refined"``, the regime-gated
    refined label) takes exactly that entry and **raises** when a frame that
    does carry a rotor track lacks it: falling back to the raw telemetry there
    would silently mix two label definitions into one pool, which is precisely
    what a refined-vs-raw label comparison cannot tolerate. A frame with no
    rotor track at all is not a rotor recording (DREGON's bench runs,
    clean-source recordings) and is still skipped with ``None``.

    The chosen entry name and its ``label_variant`` (``"refined"`` /
    ``"published"``) are recorded in the returned frame's ``"meta"``, so a
    training run's provenance names the labels it was fitted to.
