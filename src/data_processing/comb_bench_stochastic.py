"""The stochastic-comb counterpart of `comb_bench`, on the same regime axes.

WHY IT IS BUILT THIS WAY. The two families must differ in ONE thing — how the
comb is rendered — or a difference in results cannot be attributed. So this
module reuses `comb_bench`'s rotor trajectories verbatim (same centre, spread,
excursion, same two-sinusoid wander, same seed) and changes only what is put at
`k * r(t)`:

* `comb_bench` lays down a deterministic sinusoid per harmonic with a constant
  amplitude — a delta-thin line whose power is exactly `a_k`.
* Here each harmonic is a LORENTZIAN of half width `gamma0 + slope * k` Hz whose
  power drifts in time as a Gaussian process, and the whole spectrum is realized
  by filtering white noise. Every bin is then an exponential random variable
  about its mean, so even a line bin flickers by about 5.2 dB frame to frame.

That second family is the one the campaign measured at 7.2-8.2 dB of
peak-to-bulk contrast against 5.6-6.3 dB for structureless noise and 15-25 dB
for the static comb (`synthetic-solvability-limits.md`). Whether a comb that
faint is recoverable at all is the question this benchmark exists to answer, so
the knobs that set the contrast are exposed rather than buried: `gamma0_hz` and
`gamma_slope_hz` (linewidth), `line_mode` (Rayleigh realization or coherent
tones), and `harm_gp_db` (how hard the amplitudes breathe).

The four rotors share one airframe timbre (`rotor_similarity` fixed high), for
the reason recorded in `comb_bench`: independent per-rotor profiles make the
rotors separable by loudness, which no real quadrotor offers.
