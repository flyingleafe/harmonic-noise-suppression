"""Stochastic rotor-noise model — a colored floor plus Lorentzian harmonic
lines, with every amplitude drifting as a Gaussian process in time
(``kind: stochastic``).

Why this exists
---------------
The two analytic synthetic families in this project sit at the ends of a
spectrum and both are narrow. ``rotor_spectral_model.StaticCombNoisePool``
draws one static amplitude profile per clip and holds it fixed, deliberately,
so that the comb's *spacing* is the only cue an RPS predictor can use (E8).
That constraint is what makes the comb curriculum work, and it also makes every
clip of that family sound the same: no line breathes, no floor moves, and a
predictor sees one texture. The learned generator moves in time but ties its
amplitudes to the rotor speed, which hands the predictor an amplitude shortcut
that does not exist in real recordings (E7).

This module keeps the spacing-only property and gives up the staticness. Every
amplitude — each harmonic of each rotor, and the broadband floor — varies
slowly in time as a Gaussian process **drawn independently of the rotor-speed
trajectory**. A predictor therefore cannot read speed off any amplitude: the
amplitudes carry no information about it, by construction of the sampler. What
the family gains is variety, which is the point.

The model
---------
This is the generative direction of the v4 analysis model
(:mod:`tracking.joint_decompose`): a smooth colored floor with sparse
Lorentzian lines on top. The power spectral density at frequency ``f`` and time
``t`` is::

    S(f, t) = B(f, t) + sum_r sum_k P_rk(t) * L(f - k * rps_r(t); gamma_rk)

    L(d; gamma) = (1 / pi) * gamma / (d^2 + gamma^2)          (Cauchy density)

so ``P_rk(t)`` is the *power* of harmonic ``k`` of rotor ``r`` and
``gamma_rk`` is its half width at half maximum. A Lorentzian line is what a
tone with a random-walk phase actually produces, and the project has measured
the widening: a shaft that wanders by about 0.6 rev/s widens harmonic ``k`` to
about ``0.6 k`` Hz, which this model writes as
``gamma_rk = gamma0_r + slope_r * k``.

In decibels, with every term additive:

* ``10 log10 P_rk(t) = harm_mean_db + profile_db[r, k] + h_rk(t)``, where
  ``profile_db`` is the static per-rotor timbre (rolloff, blade-pass emphasis,
  per-harmonic irregularity) and ``h_rk`` is the Gaussian process.
* ``10 log10 B(f, t) = floor_mean_db + shape_db(f) + b(t)
  + tilt(t) * log2(f / f_ref)``, where ``shape_db`` is a smooth random curve in
  log frequency and ``b``, ``tilt`` are Gaussian processes.

The Gaussian processes use a squared-exponential kernel, so two knobs describe
each one: a standard deviation in decibels and a correlation time in seconds.
Those are the covariance parameters the notebook exposes as sliders.

Two structure knobs control how independent the pieces are. ``harm_coherence``
mixes a per-rotor common process into every harmonic's own process, so a rotor
can breathe as a whole instead of each line wandering alone.
``rotor_similarity`` mixes one per-clip drone timbre into every rotor's static
profile, so the four rotors of a clip can sound like four rotors of one
aircraft.

Synthesis
---------
The signal is a realization of a Gaussian process with the above spectrum, made
by filtering white noise with a time-varying filter in the short-time Fourier
domain (:func:`_ola_filter`): analyse, multiply each frame by ``sqrt(S)``,
synthesise by weighted overlap-add. Because white noise through the same
analysis and synthesis chain reconstructs exactly, the output's spectrum is
``S`` up to one global constant, and no scaling constants have to be tracked.

Two consequences of working at short-time-Fourier resolution:

* A line narrower than one frequency bin is represented at bin resolution.
  ``gamma`` is floored at ``0.6`` bins so that the discretized line keeps its
  power. At the default 2048-point analysis this floor is 4.7 Hz, which is the
  linewidth of harmonic 8 or so; lower harmonics come out slightly wider than
  the model asks for. The predictor's own front end has the same resolution.
* Everything the model produces is stochastic. There is no coherent tone and no
  absolute phase, and each microphone is an independent realization of its own
  spectrum. Across-microphone phase coherence is therefore not modeled, which
  matters for a beamformer and does not matter for a single-channel predictor.

Interfaces
----------
:func:`sample_params` draws a full parameter set, :func:`synthesize` renders one
clip from a parameter set and a rotor-speed trajectory, and
:class:`StochasticNoisePool` wraps both behind the
``sample_timeframe(rng, duration_s) -> td.Frame`` interface the other noise
pools use. Synthesis is numpy and scipy only, so it runs in the DataLoader
workers with no GPU and no producer process.

    ``n_harmonics_range`` makes the comb PARTIALLY OBSERVED: the comb length is
    drawn uniformly from ``[lo, hi]`` per clip instead of being fixed at
    ``n_harmonics``. The caller (:meth:`StochasticNoisePool.render`) otherwise
    sizes the comb so its last line lands at Nyquist, so every synthetic clip
    carries the FULL series while a real rotor's harmonics die out at some
    order that changes with the clip, the microphone and the speed. A model
    trained on full combs only can read the speed as a plain mean over
    harmonics, and on a short real comb the half rate — which covers every true
    line and pockets the empty bins between them — scores better than the truth.

    A random draw is also what keeps the band edge from becoming a speed cue.
    ``band_taper_frac`` documents the measured defect: a comb that stops dead at
    ``n_harmonics * rps`` puts its edge at a frequency proportional to the speed
    being predicted. With the length drawn per clip and independent of the

    Why this exists. Filtering white noise through a Lorentzian gives a signal
    with exactly the right power spectrum and the wrong statistics: every frame
    draws its magnitude from a Rayleigh distribution, so each line flickers by
    about 5.2 dB frame to frame and dips 20 dB below its own mean several times
    a second. A rotor harmonic does not do that. It is a tone whose amplitude is
    steady and whose PHASE wanders, and the wandering phase is what gives it a
    Lorentzian line. The two descriptions share a spectrum and differ in
    everything a comb detector reads.

    So each harmonic is built as ``A_k(t) cos(k phi_r(t) + b_rk(t))`` with
    ``phi_r`` the shaft phase from the trajectory, ``A_k`` the same amplitude the
    spectrum model asks for, and ``b_rk`` a Wiener process. A Wiener phase of
    diffusion ``D`` rad^2/s gives a Lorentzian of half width ``D / (4 pi)`` Hz,
    so ``D = 4 pi gamma`` reproduces the linewidth the model asked for.

    The returned signal is unscaled; :func:`synthesize` sets its level from the

        rng: the source of every random draw.
        n_mics: how many channels. Each is an independent realization of its
            own spectrum; the spectra differ by the per-microphone line gains.
        mic_gain_db: range of the per-(microphone, rotor) line gain draw.
        n_fft, hop: the synthesis resolution. ``hop`` defaults to a quarter
            window, which the Hann window needs for exact overlap-add.
        normalize_rms: scale the finished clip to this root-mean-square level,
            or ``None`` to keep the model's own arbitrary scale.
        level_mode: what ``normalize_rms`` refers to. ``"window"`` normalizes
            the window itself, so every window leaves at the same level
            whatever its rotors are doing. ``"flight"`` treats the number as
            the level the window would have AT THE REFERENCE SPEED and scales
            by the window's own speed-dependent amplitude instead, so a
            stopped-rotor window comes out quiet and a cruise window loud —
            which is what a real recording does, because one recorder gain
            covers a whole flight.
        line_mode: how the harmonic lines are realized. ``"stochastic"``
            filters white noise through the whole spectrum, which gives the
            right power spectrum and Rayleigh magnitudes — every line flickers
            by about 5.2 dB per frame. ``"coherent"`` renders the lines as tones
            with a wandering phase (:func:`coherent_lines`) over a filtered-noise
            floor, which is the same spectrum with the statistics a rotor
            actually produces.

    Returns:
        ``(audio (n_mics, T) float32, diagnostics)``. The diagnostics carry the
