"""Per-rotor salience layers with the lossless CRF readout, for the three ports.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. `models.salience_crf` measured the framework's shared
salience representation and found it is NOT an isomorphism: a PERFECT target,
encoded and decoded again on real training telemetry, comes back 8.24 rev/s away
on average, and 39-45% of frames land more than half a bin off. That is an
oracle floor — no model reading that representation can score better, however
well it predicts. The Gaussian-per-rotor-layer target with a CRF plus
log-parabolic readout comes back at 2.22e-16.

This module is the seam that puts the three harmonic ports on that pair. It
holds the two halves the framework contract does not:

1. ``split_maps`` — the ports keep returning ``(B, n_maps*G, T)``, because the
   ``salience_rps`` codec declares ``("batch", "freq", "time")`` and a 4-D model
   output would not type-check through it. The per-rotor layers are therefore
   STACKED ALONG THE OUTPUT AXIS and split back out here. The tensor a loss or a
   decoder sees is ``(B, R, G, T)``; only the wire format is flat.
2. ``LayerCRFReadout`` — ``predict_rps`` by one CRF best path per rotor layer,
   with NO threshold and NO Hungarian step. A stopped rotor is the path sitting
   at bin 0, which is a value; the old decoder had to call it an absence.

THE READOUT IS ``logsigmoid``, NOT THE RAW LOGIT, and the reason is the loss.
`losses.LayerPITSalienceBCELoss` drives ``sigmoid(z) -> exp(-d^2 / 2 sigma^2)``,
so it is ``log sigmoid(z)``, not ``z``, that converges to the log of a Gaussian
— and it is the log of a Gaussian that a three-point parabolic fit inverts
EXACTLY. Feeding the raw logit instead fits the vertex on
``log p - log(1 - p)``, which diverges at the peak. Measured on 40 clips of real
training telemetry (DREGON ``in_flight_noise`` minus the held-out room1, plus
FLY125) by pushing a PERFECT model's output — ``logit(target)`` — through this
decode, on the ports' own 0-150 rev/s grid at 0.5017 rev/s:

    readout        mean err        max err
    logsigmoid     3.55e-15        1.42e-14
    raw logit      5.93e-02        9.84e-01

``readout="raw"`` keeps the other branch available for that comparison.

THE BAND IS SIZED FROM THE SAME MEASUREMENT. At ``MAX_STEP_REV_S = 16`` the same
round trip returns 1.22e-05 mean and 0.203 max: exact almost everywhere, and
wrong on the frames whose slew the band does not make free, where the transition
penalty shaves the corner of a ramp. Those clips reach 23.8 rev/s in one 32 ms
frame, so 16 is too small for them and 25 is not — at 25 the error is the
``logsigmoid`` row above, everywhere.
