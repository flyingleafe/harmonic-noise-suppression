"""HarmoF0 (Wei et al., ISMIR 2022) UNMODIFIED, as a rotor-rate salience model.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `models.harmonic_ports.harmof0_rps` is HarmoF0 with its
harmonic organ replaced: `MRDConv`'s log-axis SHIFT became an explicit gather at
``k * r`` on the linear STFT, and the 352-bin semitone grid became a 0-150 rev/s
linear grid. Those two substitutions are the campaign's claim, and a claim needs
a control. This module is that control — the published architecture, kept whole,
wired into the same `salience_rps` task, so the pair
``hb_sal_hf0_orig`` / ``hf0_*`` isolates what the substitutions buy.

WHAT IS KEPT. Everything the paper has:

* `WaveformToLogSpecgram` — a uniform STFT (``n_fft = 2 * n_freq``, Hann
  window, POWER) linearly interpolated onto ``freq_bins`` log-spaced bins at
  ``bins_per_octave`` from ``fmin``, then `AmplitudeToDB(top_db=80)`.
* `MRDConv` — the multi-rate dilated convolution. One 1x1 convolution per
  harmonic ``k``, its output read at an offset of ``round(log2(k) * B)`` bins,
  all summed. On a log axis that offset IS the position of ``k * f``.
* Blocks 2-4 — ``conv 3x3 -> ReLU -> conv [1,3] dilated by B -> ReLU ->
  BatchNorm``, the octave-sized dilated context convolutions.
* ``conv_5``/``conv_6`` — the 128 -> 64 -> 1 pair of 1x1 convolutions that emit
  the salience map.
* The layout ``(B, C, T, freq)``, so every kernel walks the axes the paper says.

The defaults are HarmoF0's own: ``n_freq=512`` (thus ``n_fft=1024``),
``fmin=27.5``, ``bins_per_octave=48``, ``freq_bins=352``, ``n_har=12``,
``channels=(32, 64, 128, 128)``, ``dilation_rates=(48, 48, 48, 48)``.

DEVIATIONS, all forced by the task seam and none of them structural:

1. HOP. The published `PitchTracker` frames the waveform at ``hop = 160``
   (10 ms) OUTSIDE the network and hands it ``[b, num_frames, 1024]``. Here the
   framing is `torch.stft` at ``hop = 512``, this project's frame grid, with
   ``center=True`` so the frame count is ``n // hop + 1`` and matches every
   dataset, loss and metric in the campaign. The per-frame arithmetic is
   identical (Hann window, then squared magnitude of the rfft); only the frame
   POSITIONS move, plus the reflect padding at the two ends that ``center=True``
   adds. ``n_fft`` stays 1024, so the analysis window and the 15.625 Hz bin
   spacing are the paper's.
2. LOGITS. HarmoF0 ends in a sigmoid. `losses.SalienceRPSBCELoss` takes LOGITS
   (``BCEWithLogits``), so the sigmoid moves out of the model and into the loss.
   This is the same model: ``BCEWithLogitsLoss(x) == BCELoss(sigmoid(x))``.
3. BATCH AXIS. The released ``forward`` does ``x = specgram[None, :]``, which
   promotes the BATCH to the channel axis and only computes the paper's model
   when ``b == 1`` (their `PitchTracker` asserts exactly that). Here the batch
   stays the batch and the channel axis is 1, which is what the training code in
   the same repository (``train/src/mono_pitch/nets.py``) does.
4. MULTI-PITCH. HarmoF0 is monophonic — one map, one peak per frame. ``n_maps=1``
   keeps that map and reads it MULTI-HOT: four rotors, four bumps, the shared
   representation every `salience_rps` row uses. ``n_maps>1`` emits one map per
   rotor and reaches `LayerCRFReadout`, exactly as in the ports, so a later
   config can ask for per-rotor layers on this log grid without a code change.

WHAT THE GRID MEANS HERE. Under the project's ``f0 = rps`` convention a bin at
``f`` Hz is a candidate rate of ``f`` rev/s, so the paper's grid spans
27.5-4370 rev/s in 352 log-spaced bins. Rotors live in 0-150 rev/s, that is bins
0-118; the remaining 233 bins are the harmonics' home and carry no fundamental.
The bin spacing is 1.45% of the rate — 0.40 rev/s at 27.5, 0.58 at 40, 2.2 at
150 — against the ports' uniform 0.5017 rev/s. A stopped rotor has no bin at all
(the target builder marks a rotor active only above 0.1 Hz, so it becomes a dark
column), which is the same convention `multif0_salience` and
`basic_pitch_salience` already train under.

THE PUBLISHED INTERPOLATION IS SWAPPED, AND IT IS REPRODUCED. The upstream
weights are ``w_floor = x - floor(x)`` and ``w_ceil = ceil(x) - x``, applied to
the floor and ceiling bins RESPECTIVELY — the two are the wrong way round for
linear interpolation, which needs ``1 - (x - floor(x))`` on the floor bin. The
effect is a deterministic sawtooth warp of the frequency axis, at most one FFT
bin (15.6 Hz) wide, identical at training and at test, and the released
checkpoints were trained through it. Thus it is part of the published
model and is kept. ``published_interp=False`` swaps it back, for the follow-up
that asks whether it costs anything at 16 kHz.

LEVEL L2 — THE LINEAR OUTPUT GRID (``superres_out=True``). The regime matrix
(docs/experiments/paper-regime-matrix.md § "Block S") defines L2 as per-rotor
Gaussian layers on the 0-150 rev/s linear grid with the CRF readout, ORIGINAL
INPUT. Everything above is the original input: the front end, `MRDConv`,
blocks 2-4 and ``conv_5``/``conv_6`` are untouched, and the seam is the one
`models.salience_rps.LateDeepSalience` already carries for the same level —
`models.salience_rps.FreqSuperResHead`, a fixed linear interpolation of the
``n_maps x 352`` log-grid logits onto ``out_bins`` uniform bins over
``[out_fmin, out_fmax]`` followed by a small ``(head_kernel, 1)`` sharpening
stack of width ``head_hidden``. It is attached as ``superres_head`` (the name
both controls use for it; `HPPNetOrig` cannot call it ``head`` because that is
its `FreqGroupLSTM`) and ``out_freqs`` becomes the linear grid, so the
`salience_layers_r150` loss, the `LayerCRFReadout` band and the metrics all
read one uniform axis. ``n_maps > 1`` REQUIRES it, as it does in
`LateDeepSalience`: the log-parabolic readout and the CRF band are defined on
a uniform axis, and on this log grid the band sized from the median spacing
admits far more than 25 rev/s at the bottom and far less at the top.

The known L2 limit carries over verbatim from conf/model/multif0_salience_l4.yaml:
`FreqSuperResHead` CLAMPS output bins outside the input span, so every output
bin below the input ``fmin`` (27.5 rev/s here — bins 0-54 of the 300) reads the
same bottom input bin and the sharpening stack has to separate them on context
alone. L2 may not move the input to buy that band; L3 (`harmof0_rps`) is the
level that does.

    tracking at eval. The output axis is the paper's own log-spaced grid, so

    Args:
        n_fft, hop_length: the frame grid `predict_rps` resamples its output

        num_rotors: rotors to track at eval.
        sr: sample rate the log-bin table is computed for.
        n_freq: HarmoF0's ``n_freq``; the front end's ``n_fft`` is twice it.
        fmin, bins_per_octave, freq_bins: the log grid. The paper's 27.5 / 48 /
            352 spans 88 semitones from A0.
        n_har: harmonics `MRDConv` reads (the paper's 12).
        channels, dilation_rates: the four blocks' widths and their octave-sized
            frequency dilations (the paper's ``(32, 64, 128, 128)`` and 48).
        published_interp: keep the upstream's swapped interpolation weights.
        n_maps: salience maps emitted. 1 is the shared multi-hot map; > 1 stacks
