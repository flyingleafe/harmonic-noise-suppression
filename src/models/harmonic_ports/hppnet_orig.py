"""HPPNet (Wei et al., ISMIR 2022) UNMODIFIED, as a rotor-rate salience model.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `models.harmonic_ports.hppnet_rps` is HPPNet with its
harmonic organ replaced: `HarmonicDilatedConv`'s eight log-axis dilated branches
became an explicit gather at ``k * r`` on the linear STFT, the CQT became a
uniform STFT, and the 352-bin semitone grid became a 0-150 rev/s linear grid.
This module is the control for that claim — the published architecture, kept
whole, on the same `salience_rps` task, so the pair ``hb_sal_hppnet_orig`` /
``hppnet_*`` isolates what the substitutions buy.

WHAT IS KEPT. Everything the paper's frame path has:

* The CQT front end — nnAudio, ``fmin`` 27.5, 352 bins at 48 per octave, then
  `AmplitudeToDB(top_db=80)`, exactly the call in ``hppnet/transcriber.py``.
* `HarmonicDilatedConv` — eight ``Conv2d([1, 3], dilation=[1, d])`` branches at
  ``d = 48, 76, 96, 111, 124, 135, 144, 152``, summed, then ReLU. Those are
  ``round(log2(k) * 48)`` for ``k = 2..9``: harmonic offsets on the log axis.
* `CNNTrunk` — ``block_1/2/2_5`` (7x7, 1 -> 16 -> 16 -> 16), ``conv_3`` (the
  harmonic convolution, 16 -> 128), ``block_4`` (``[1,3]`` dilated by 48),
  ``block_5`` (``[1,3]`` dilated by 12), ``block_6/7/8`` (``[5,1]``, temporal).
  ``conv -> ReLU -> InstanceNorm2d`` throughout, `padding='same'`.
* `FreqGroupLSTM` — every frequency position folded into the batch, one shared
  `BiLSTM` along time, then a `Linear` to the output channels. ONE recurrence
  for the whole axis, which is the module's whole point.
* The layout ``(B, C, T, freq)``.

WHAT IS DROPPED. The onset, offset and velocity heads and the whole
``onset_subnet``: they are note-boundary and MIDI-loudness events, which a
rotor trajectory does not have. Only the FRAME (multi-pitch) head is ported,
which is what the task asks for and what the port already does.

DEVIATIONS, and what forces each:

1. NO FREQUENCY POOL (``freq_pool=1``). HPPNet's ``block_4`` carries
   ``MaxPool2d([1, 4])``, which takes the 4x-oversampled log axis (352 bins)
   down to one bin per SEMITONE (88), because its output is a piano roll. A
   rotor rate is not quantized to semitones, and 88 bins over 88 semitones is
   5.95% per bin — 2.4 rev/s at 40 rev/s, an order of magnitude past the
   campaign's 0.2 rev/s floor, which would make this arm a measurement of the
   pool and not of the log axis. Thus the pool is off and the grid stays at
   352 bins (1.45% per bin). ``freq_pool=4`` restores the published trunk, and
   ``output_freqs()`` follows it to the pooled bin centers.
2. NO TIME POOL (``time_pooling=False``). HPPNet's frame subnet runs
   ``max_pool2d([2, 1])`` on its input and `F.interpolate(mode='bilinear')` on
   its output, so the frame head works at HALF the frame rate. Bilinear
   upsampling a one-bin-wide salience bump makes every odd frame a blend of its
   neighbours, and on this project's 32 ms grid a rotor moves up to 23.8 rev/s
   per frame, so the blend is not a small error. ``time_pooling=True`` restores
   it.
3. WHAT THE POOL TOOK WITH IT. ``block_5`` is dilated by 12, which is one
   OCTAVE on the 12-bin-per-octave axis the pool produces. With the pool off
   it walks a quarter of an octave instead. The published NUMBER is kept,
   because one deviation at a time is what makes the arm readable;
   ``dilations`` ``[48, 48]`` restores the published MEANING, for the
   follow-up that asks which of the two the block was really using.
4. HOP. HPPNet runs at 16 kHz with ``hop = 320`` (20 ms). This uses ``hop =
   512``, this project's frame grid — every dataset, loss and metric in the
   campaign is on it. Same reason as the port's deviation 1.
5. CQT2010v2, NOT nnAudio's plain ``CQT``. ``nnAudio.Spectrogram.CQT`` builds
   ONE kernel for the whole range, and at ``fmin`` 27.5 with 48 bins per octave
   ``Q = 1 / (2 ** (1 / 48) - 1) = 68.8``, so the lowest kernel is 40000 samples
   and nnAudio rounds ``n_fft`` up to 65536. It then reflect-pads by 32768 and
   RAISES on any clip shorter than 4.1 s — including this project's 1 s training
   clips. `CQT2010v2` computes the same grid octave by octave with downsampling
   and runs on 1 s. The consequence is real and belongs in the read-out of this
   arm: a 48-bin-per-octave CQT at 27.5 Hz needs a 2.5 s analysis window at the
   bottom bin, which a 1 s clip does not have.
6. FMIN 27.5 EXACTLY. The transcriber passes ``27.5 / 2 ** (1 / 24)``, half a
   semitone low, so that each group of four bins is centred on a MIDI note
   before the ``[1, 4]`` pool. With the pool off there is no group to centre,
   and 27.5 puts this arm on bit-identical bins to `HarmoF0Orig`, so one
   `conf/loss/salience_bce_orig.yaml` serves both and the two are read on one
   axis.
7. LOGITS. `FreqGroupLSTM` ends in a sigmoid, and the framework's
   `losses.SalienceRPSBCELoss` takes logits, so the sigmoid moves into the loss.
   ``BCEWithLogitsLoss(x) == BCELoss(sigmoid(x))``.
8. MULTI-PITCH. HPPNet's frame head is already polyphonic, one bin per pitch;
   ``n_maps=1`` reads it multi-hot (four rotors, four bumps). ``n_maps>1`` emits
   one map per rotor and reaches `LayerCRFReadout`, as in the ports.

WHAT THE GRID MEANS HERE. Under ``f0 = rps`` the 352 bins span 27.5-4370 rev/s,
of which rotors occupy bins 0-118. See `harmof0_orig` for the full reading of
that axis; the two share it exactly.

LEVEL L2 — THE LINEAR OUTPUT GRID (``superres_out=True``). The same seam
`harmof0_orig` carries, read there in full: the whole published path above —
CQT, `HarmonicDilatedConv`, `CNNTrunk`, `FreqGroupLSTM` — is untouched, and
its ``n_maps x 352`` log-grid logits pass through
`models.salience_rps.FreqSuperResHead` onto ``out_bins`` uniform bins over
``[out_fmin, out_fmax]``. The adapter is ``superres_head``, NOT ``head``:
``head`` is HPPNet's own `FreqGroupLSTM`, and that name stays on the
published module so the L0 checkpoints keep loading. ``n_maps > 1`` requires
it, as in `LateDeepSalience`, because `LayerCRFReadout`'s band and vertex fit
are defined on a uniform axis. The clamp below the CQT's ``fmin`` (output bins
0-54 read the bottom input bin) is L2's documented limit and is not moved here.

            and the target time grid are one grid; ``n_fft`` is recorded only
            (the CQT has no ``n_fft`` of its own to agree with).
        num_rotors: rotors to track at eval.
        sr, fmin, n_bins, bins_per_octave: the CQT grid.
        c_har, embedding: HPPNet's trunk widths (16 and 128).
        lstm_size: `FreqGroupLSTM`'s recurrent width. Its cost is ``B * F``
            sequences of length ``T``; with the frequency pool off ``F`` is 352
            against HPPNet's 88, so this is the model's memory knob.
        dilations: ``block_4``/``block_5`` frequency dilations. The published
            ``(48, 12)`` is one octave on each block's own axis only when the
            frequency pool is on (deviation 3).
        freq_pool, time_pooling: the two published pools (deviations 1 and 2).
        n_maps: salience maps emitted. > 1 stacks per-rotor layers along the
            output axis for `LayerCRFReadout` and needs ``superres_out=True``.
