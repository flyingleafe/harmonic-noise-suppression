"""Multi-pitch architectures ported to rotor-rate salience on a LINEAR STFT.

Every ``*_rps`` model in this package is one paper architecture with a single
organ replaced: the log-frequency harmonic SHIFT becomes an explicit GATHER at
``k * r``. `docs/harmonic-ports-design.md` carries the measurements behind that
substitution; do not re-derive them here.

The ``*_orig`` models are the CONTROLS for that substitution — the same two
papers with nothing replaced, on their own 352-bin log grid, wired into the same
`salience_rps` task. Read the pair, not either one alone.

THE MODELS LOAD ON FIRST USE, and the reason is an import cycle. Each model
here imports ``models.salience_rps`` for its base class, and
``models.salience_rps`` now imports ``LayerCRFReadout`` back out of this
package, because the two multi-pitch salience baselines read per-rotor layers
with the same mixin. ``layer_readout`` itself depends on nothing in this
package, so exporting it eagerly and the models lazily removes the cycle
without moving a file or changing an import path.
