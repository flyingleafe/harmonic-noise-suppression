"""Per-rotor salience layers with a CRF readout — a LOSSLESS encode/decode pair.

THE GATE THIS MODULE EXISTS TO PASS. Encoding real training trajectories into a
salience map and decoding them back must be an isomorphism: whatever a model
loses, the representation itself must lose nothing. Measured on 40 clips of real
training telemetry (DREGON ``in_flight_noise`` minus the held-out room1, plus
FLY125; speeds 0.00-91.58 rev/s, per-frame |d rps| mean 0.718, p99 3.008, max
15.301), on a 0-150 rev/s grid at 0.5 rev/s:

    encode/decode pair                              max err     mean err
    triangular kernel, SHARED map, Hungarian        83.53       8.24
    Gaussian layers, CRF + log-parabolic            2.22e-16    2.22e-16

The old pair loses 8.24 rev/s on a PERFECT target, and 39-45% of frames land
more than 0.5 rev/s away. That is an oracle floor: no model reading that
representation can score better, however well it predicts. Three separate causes,
all fixed here:

1. ONE MAP CANNOT HOLD FOUR ROTORS. DREGON's rotor pairs sit 0.13-0.86 rev/s
   apart, inside a single 0.5 rev/s bin, so a shared map has fewer peaks than
   rotors and the tracker assigns several tracks to one peak. One layer per rotor
   removes the failure completely -- there is nothing left to merge.
2. THE KERNEL MUST BE GAUSSIAN. ``log`` of a Gaussian is a parabola *globally*,
   so a three-point log-parabolic fit recovers the peak's sub-bin position
   EXACTLY from any three consecutive bins. The framework's triangular kernel has
   no such property and leaves a quantization residue.
3. ZERO IS A VALUE, NOT AN ABSENCE. ``salience_target_from_resampled_rps`` drops
   any rotor below 0.1 rev/s (``active = rps_grid > 0.1``), so a stopped rotor
   lights no bin and "stopped" is encoded as absence of evidence -- which is what
   forces a decode threshold. Here a stopped rotor is simply a peak at bin 0.

The transition band must also admit what real rotors do: 15.3 rev/s in one 32 ms
frame at the extreme, which is 31 bins at 0.5 rev/s, against the 3 bins the comb
tracker's default allows. `band_for_rev_s` sizes it from that number rather than
from a slew constant chosen on synthetic data.
