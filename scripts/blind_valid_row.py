"""The blind tracker's row of the unified RPS leaderboard, on the V4 valid split.

``dload:DREGON-LM-V4-michaels-valid-full`` is 37 clips of 8 s cut from FOUR
parent recordings — DREGON ``free-flight_{nosource,speech-low,whitenoise-low}_room1``
and Michael's ``FLY124``. The blind ladder wants a 20 s window, so this driver
does what the corpus campaign does and annotates the PARENT recordings, then
scores the stitched full-span track on the clips' own STFT frames.

Two stages, one CLI:

1. ``annotate`` — one unit is one (recording, window). The worker is
   ``scripts/blind_corpus.Worker`` unchanged, so the ladder call, the guard
   readings and the label-free instruments are the corpus campaign's, call for
   call. Products: ``raw/<uid>.json`` (the readings), ``traj/<uid>.npz`` (the
   trajectory) and ``windows/<uid>.npz`` (the cached window audio).
2. ``score`` — stitch the windows of each recording, decode a REFUSED window to
   0 rev/s, interpolate onto every clip's 2048/512 frame grid, and pool the
   per-frame Hungarian error by regime.

**The arm.** ``vit2dsp`` is the run of record: ``tracking.vit2dsp`` is the
calibrated blind-annotation ladder that reads DREGON pooled ``err_sm`` 0.688
and FLY124 cruise 1.027 (``docs/experiments/beat-vk.md`` § Goal), and its guard
is inside ``vit2dsp_pipeline`` — the script never assembles a ladder. It is
also a CRUISE arm: it carries one rate law across the window, so the warm-up,
take-off and landing parts of this full-envelope split are its weak regime.
``--arm fullrange`` (``tracking.blind_fullrange``) is the ramp-capable
alternative and reads DREGON cruise 1.809 / FLY124 cruise 2.515 / warm-up 3.607
on the beat-VK protocol. Run both if the leaderboard has room for two rows.

**The channel convention.** One trajectory per RECORDING, from all 8
microphones: ``blind_seed`` channel-averages its whitened spectrogram and the
ladder's stage 2 is a SPATIAL joint Viterbi. The corpus campaign measured that
a mono seed collapses (DREGON PIT-MAE 1.81 -> 18.76), so the 8-channel form is
the only defensible one. The eight channels of one clip therefore share one
prediction, and the pooled MAE is identical whether a channel is counted once
or eight times.

**The zero convention** (user decision, full envelope). A window the acceptance
gates refuse, a window whose unit failed, and any span no window covers all
decode to 0 rev/s on all four rotors. Nothing is dropped from the pools.

**The gates.** ``docs/experiments/blind-corpus-annotation.md`` § "Acceptance
gates" makes the rule ARM-DEPENDENT, and this is a four-rotor arm, so the
default set is:

- ``g1`` — ``fvk_ratio_double >= 1.065``. Calibrated on DREGON room2 twice,
  17 of 17 both times.
- ``g5`` — the four annotated rates stay inside 12 rev/s of each other.

``pr`` (the per-rotor half margin, cut -1.5 dB) is available and is OFF by
default: the room1 run against MEASURED telemetry found the cut unsafe at four
rotors — it crosses on 2 of 19 windows, one of which has a PIT-MAE of 1.08
rev/s and is one of the best windows of the whole campaign. ``g4`` (continuity:
consecutive windows must agree inside their overlap to better than 1 rev/s) is
also available and OFF by default, because it refuses BOTH members of a
disagreeing pair and this split is mostly ramp. ``score`` always reports the
ungated numbers beside the gated ones, and re-scoring under a different gate
set costs seconds.

**The stitch.** Windows overlap by 4 s and the cut is at the MIDPOINT: a frame
takes the trajectory of the window whose center is nearest. No cross-fade —
two windows can name their rotors in different orders, and averaging rows
across a permutation would invent a trajectory neither window produced.

**The clip-to-parent join.** The published split's ``metadata.json`` carries
``recording_id`` and an AUDIO-RELATIVE ``start_time`` per clip, and ``score``
reads it directly — ``DregonLMFrameDataset`` looks for that file beside the
split directory, which a dload materialization does not have, so the dataset's
own ``meta`` entry is empty. ``score`` then PROVES the join rather than
trusting it: see :func:`verify_mapping`.

Smoke, measured (one window, this laptop, 4 BLAS threads)::

  python scripts/blind_valid_row.py annotate --recordings free-flight_nosource_room1 \\
      --windows 1 --jobs 1 --omp 4 --out results/blind_valid_row/smoke
  python scripts/blind_valid_row.py score --annot results/blind_valid_row/smoke

126.4 s of wall time for the 20 s window — ladder 82.6, F_VK 36.0, ridge 2.9,
per-rotor octave 4.9 — and the window reads a PIT error of 1.058 rev/s against
the parent's tachometer, which is inside the campaign's room1 cruise band of
0.97 to 1.22. The two clips it fully covers score 0.788 and 0.735 rev/s.

Full run (cluster). The four parents give 20 windows (4 + 4 + 4 DREGON, 8
FLY124), and the corpus campaign measured about 400 CPU-s per window at one
BLAS thread, so the grid is about 2.2 CPU-hours::

  omnirun submit --backend uni-cpu --gpus 0 --cpus 8 --time 2h --yes -- \\
      python scripts/blind_valid_row.py annotate --jobs 8 --omp 1 \\
          --out results/blind_valid_row/vit2dsp

**The phase-refinement ablation (search -> phase iterations).** The published
``vit2dsp`` row above stays the historical reference. The ablation asks what
the phase-increment refinement adds to the ladder's pre-VK dynamic
search, so it runs on one persisted search and differs only in the phase
iteration count:

1. ``--arm vit2dsp_dp`` — ``tracking.vit2dsp`` with
   ``Vit2dspConfig(stop_after="vit2dsp")``: blind seed -> Viterbi pair-mean
   c(t) -> spatial joint 2-rotor DP, returned before any VK stage runs (the
   ``vit2dsp`` snapshot of ``vit2dsp_pipeline``). Same seed config, pair /
   octave search, eight microphones, window and grid as the run of record.
2. ``--init-traj-dir <search>/traj --phase-iterations N`` — the unit's
   ``rps`` is that persisted trajectory read back verbatim (sha256 recorded;
   a missing source, a mismatched window, or window audio that is not
   sample-identical to the source campaign's raises — nothing is reseeded),
   and the only stage run is ``pi_kalman_stage(replace(PI_PROTOCOL,
   n_iter=N))`` on the unmodified clip — no peel, no VK. ``PI_PROTOCOL`` is
   ``n_iter=3``, ``band_hz=6``, ``pair_mode="joint"`` over the core's
   ``k_caps=(8, 20, 40)``; iteration ``j`` uses cap ``k_caps[j]`` regardless of how many
   follow, so ``N=1`` is exactly the protocol's first iteration and ``N=3``
   the full protocol. The row's ``wall_ladder_s`` is search + phase, with
   both parts kept (``init_wall_ladder_s``, ``wall_phase_s``).

The instruments, the gates, the stitch and the score are the same code for
all three rows::
