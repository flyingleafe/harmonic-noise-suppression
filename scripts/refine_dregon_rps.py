"""Refine the DREGON generator-training telemetry with the L-BFGS F_VK refiner.

The generator trains on DREGON ``in_flight_noise`` recordings whose rotor-speed
labels are the raw tachometer telemetry, and that telemetry carries a
scale-like error of 0.35-0.85 % (``docs/experiments/telemetry-fitness.md`` § 6d).
Phase 7 measured what that costs: a constant 0.5 % label bias alone takes 8.6 dB
off the generated line energy at harmonics 50-80. This driver replaces the
labels of the whole recording with the trajectory that
:func:`tracking.fitness_vk.optimize_trajectory` finds — window by window, then
stitched — and writes a committed sidecar per recording.

The data path is the GENERATOR's, not a protocol's: recordings come from
``data_processing.noise_rps_dataset.load_published_noise_sources`` with exactly
the arguments generator training uses, and the audio and telemetry refined here
are the ones training sees. Which recordings those are is one seam,
:func:`source_profile`, and it is the same seam ``scripts/vk_decompose.py``
carries — the spec picks the profile:

``frames:DREGON-frames`` (the default)
    Origin ``dregon``, rotor speeds from ``motors_measured``, and the splits
    ``--splits`` names (``in_flight_noise`` by default, the generator's own
    training pool; ``in_flight_source`` is the same rig and the same telemetry
    key with speech in the recording).

any spec naming ``michaels``
    Origin ``michaels``, rotor speeds from the generic ``rps`` track, every
    split. Michael's FLY124/FLY125 telemetry is the RECALIBRATED one (lag and
    a 0.7 % scale already taken out), so what this driver measures on it is
    what is left after that calibration, not the raw tachometer error.

The acceptance policy is not per profile — ``IDLE_REV_S``, ``CRUISE_REV_S`` and
``MAX_MOVE_REV_S`` are absolute rates in rev/s, and both rigs cruise well above
them. The sidecar's times are seconds from the audio
``t_start`` of the PUBLISHED recording — the loader trims each frame to the
audio-telemetry overlap (5.48 s on ``free-flight_nosource_room1``) and the trim
is added back at stitch time, so a consumer can apply the labels to the
untrimmed frame. Every epoch conversion runs in integer ticks: the published
frames sit at ~1e18 ticks, which float64 cannot subtract without loss.

Three things this driver adds on top of the refiner:

``smooth_lambda`` is rescaled per window
    Every unit runs the refiner with ``smooth_lambda="auto"``
    (:func:`tracking.auto_smooth_lambda`), which holds the log-domain prior of
    the window's own telemetry init to half the (normalized, order-1) data term.
    The refiner's fixed default 1.0 is calibrated for a cruise window
    (prior ~0.8); on a takeoff ramp the same prior reads 244, so the fixed
    weight swamps the data term and the window cannot move at all. The weight
    used and the init prior it came from are reported per unit.

Two acceptance guards
    A window falls back to its telemetry when the F_VK objective did not improve
    or when the refinement moved a rotor by more than ``MAX_MOVE_REV_S``. At
    cruise the expected movement is the known -0.6 % scale, about 0.4 rev/s.

Idle windows are not refined
    Below ``IDLE_REV_S`` there is no comb to fit; the telemetry passes through.
