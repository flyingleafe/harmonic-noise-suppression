# Drive one training run as a chain of short GPU jobs.
#
#   scripts/chain_train.sh <experiment> <job-prefix> [max-segments] [backend] [time]
#
# Why: the only long-GPU Slurm partition here (omnirun backend `uni` = sae) is
# ~160 jobs deep with multi-day start estimates, while `uni-gpushort` has idle
# nodes but a hard 1 h wall clock. Since `resume=true` now genuinely restores
# optimizer/scheduler/epoch state (src/training/loop.py), a run can be carried
# across many short jobs instead of waiting for one long one.
#
# omnirun's own `--after` dependency flag takes a daemonless code path that
# cannot see the daemon's backend config ("unknown backend 'uni-gpushort'"), so
# the chaining is done here: submit one segment, wait for it to finish, submit
# the next. The loop stops early when the training loop reports it has nothing
# left to resume (early stop or epoch budget reached), so an over-long chain
# costs nothing.
#
# RESULTS_ROOT is passed so the run dir lives OUTSIDE the per-revision worktree
# that omnirun creates; otherwise any commit made mid-chain would send the next
# segment to an empty directory and silently restart training at epoch 0.
